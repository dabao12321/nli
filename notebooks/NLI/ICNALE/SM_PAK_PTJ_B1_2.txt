Part-time jobs are not important for the students.  I disagree with the topic because these jobs do not – because these jobs are not good for the students.  In that – in that way that the students have to work a lot and then they get affected.  They didn't know how to manage time.  Their health is affected.  They have to struggle a lot in this job and the jobs are really hectic.  They engage a lot of time and hard work.  The hard work, if the student is – is done – uh, is – the hard job – the work is – the jobs are affect the health of the students and they have to work really hard.  These jobs are good – not good because they have to work a lot and these jobs...
Okay, the topic is that part-time job is beneficial for student or not?  Okay.  According to me, I think it is not good for the student because if they do work, they cannot pay proper attention to their work and to their studies, and there they consume a lot of time in doing their part-time  --  part-time job and which they can serve in their study and then moreover it is not good for student because whatever kind of job they do, they also have in their mind about their studies.  So the job is also not done by  --  in very, very good attention or it means they cannot do their job well.  But the reason is that the wise students do part-time jobs is the financial value and due to the financial problem the stu  --  students are compelled to do jobs.
It is not necessary for every student to have a part-time job because during his university or college studies because it has a very negative impact on the studies of the student.  Every student wants to get his education free from any kind of pressure.  Free from any kind of pressure but there are few who cannot afford those expenses.  For example, their parents cannot afford.  For that they have to do a part-time job, but it is very difficult to handle because it has a direct impact on the studies of the students.  They are unable to compete with other students.  It has a very – they – they – sometimes they are short of their attendance.  They are unable to complete their classes, but still there is still...
These days many teenagers who go to school or university also work.  It might be the odd weekend bartending job or it can be a part-time job.  The most important reason of my opinion is that holding the job outside of school or college get the student exposure.  Students need a very certain lifestyle while they are at home, school and college.  Working while studying allows the student to be more independent instead of begging for pocket money from their parents.  These students can easily earn money and spend it as they want.  Mmm, when teenagers hold a job while studying, it also makes them appreciated the volume of money, and these days many teenagers who go to school or university...
So the part-time job is also part – some of the students do part-time job to meet their expenses during the studies and their second chance is compulsion to do part-time jobs but somehow it has bad effects on their studies because they have to spend a lot of time in school and colleges and universities for study and after this they have to do their part-time job till they are exposed and so they do not get some proper time.  They do not get proper time to studies or it – it – it affects their – it affects their class also and it affects their study also.  Jobs for continuously working...
No, part-time jobs are not good for college students.  It requires a lot of time and energy from them when they do studies as well as – as well as their part-time job with it.  Students will have not enough time to study and to sit with family and with relatives, neighbors and friends.  They won't be able to study well and they would get tired physical and mentally so early and they will also become unhealthy and they – and they won't be able to get a proper sleep when they do part-time jobs along with their studies and they won't be able to focus properly on their studies and do well in them and they will – they won't also have enough time for family and – family and friends to sit in – and sit with them and have a talk.  They won't have time to relax.
I disagree that students have to do part-time job because part-time jobs are difficult task to do especially for those who have to continue their studies along with their jobs.  Mostly the students who are not able to pay their fees have to do a part-time job.  Uhh, part-time job affect badly on their studies because they could not pay proper attention to their studies and their grades also gradually became lower and then the students who are doing part-time job has to work hard and continuously because – because of this continuous work their health effect badly because they could not take proper sleep and proper rest.  Continuous – continuous work effects – not effects their health only...
Part-time job for students is not good thing.  Because when he gets part-time job, he cannot give proper time to his education.  And they create lots of problems.  You can create like low attendance, decreasing his grades in examination and in future, he will not get good jobs.  I think this is not only for the student but in any other way when we saw because he goes for part-time job, it is placed also, not give proper time.  Then over  --  then we do not give proper time to anyone in university.  It do not give us good results.  So students should give complete focus on education because first of all we should learn education.  First of all, we should -- 

The idea of students doing part-time jobs is an old rather controversial one.  People are having mixed opinion in this regards.  Those who favor this notion believe that part-time jobs can better train the youngster about the practical life.  Part-time job can also help meeting financial needs of students.  However, if I make sense, part-time jobs have an adverse effect on the education of the individual as they lost the concentration on their studies.  I am in favor of part-time jobs for students; students will have to start their practical life eventually to earn their bread and butter.  Those having the jobs from high school can develop the positive attitude towards work place but not the notion of hard work, responsibility and commitment better than others which will play a vital role in securing a good job.  Employer offer...

It is a good idea for student to have part-time job because getting a job everyone needs to try experience, in that this is the best period in human life to observe knowledge and learn experience.  For some reason, I think student should take part of job.  Some reasons is that, one is that student they can get experience, students will learn to study  --  study behavior of human when they interact with different people.  So I think it's a good time to part  --  to take part-time job.  In addition when doing a part-time job, student, it can practice the learning they got from class as practical.  Knowledge you got from teacher is never enough and never fulfilled your needs.  It's just theoretical but when they take part-time job, they do practical.  So their class experience change into practical when students is doing practice.

Nowadays, more and more students decide to have a part-time job during their study in colleges.  Part-time job has both merits and demerits.  Part-time job makes students much more financially independent.  It can relieve student's financially burden.  They take part-time job to pay their tuition and cost of living.  Part-time job can be more effective if they are related to the students and their studies.  By taking the part-time job, students can relax to new experience and new friends.  Additionally, taking the part-time job is beneficial to the cultivation of independence and sense of responsibility.

First is that the – the job should be related to the student's field in which he is studying and the second thing is that student must be – and there should not any financial pressure upon student to do that job.  He should do this job willingly because there are many advantages of doing part-time job for a student.  As they studied – they learn – they study about theory.  By doing job, they will get practice.  They will become expert in that field.  They will become student of – get responsible.  They will know that they have to perform their duty in the future life.

Well, I think part-time job is good as well as bad for a student.  Good in the sense that student with part-time job are more confident and can manage time more successfully and skillfully than other students.  Part-time job also provides student experience in other fields like if they are doing job at a hotel as a waiter or as a high school as a teacher.  So they will also – the part-time students would have more confidence than the other students.  On the other hand, it is also bad because sometimes these jobs affect student as physical and mental tiredness.  They cannot concentrate on their studies.

Part-time  --  part-time jobs are really good for students and depend upon their career objective and selection.  If they get a job in their relevant area of specialization, then what would be great and after finishing their education, they have experience in their profile which give weightage in the selection procedures for further jobs and further prospects.  But students need to do proper planning and take necessary step accordingly.  Only in the summer, you have plenty for time for a job, career when you are an adult.  Right now, you should be taking advantage of the many school activities offered to you.  If you have a specific career in mind, then seek a volunteer position in the field.  You can learn about the career and if it is something you might earlier really want to pursue.  The work you interest -- 
In my point of view, it is important for some students who have not enough money to complete their education.  These kinds of students like to save money for their important and fundamental needs  --  for their textbooks or fees.  Students also get other benefits as working, teaching students about responsibility.  And they become mature and responsible and  --  and learn management skill  --  learning management skill.  They try to handle different kind of people.  Students who get the part-time job also suffer with some problems.  As students do part-time jobs, they do not get proper time and proper attention for their homework as done for the college work.
Some people  --  it depends on persons and it varies from person to person.  Some people belong to high status and some people do not belong to high status and for those who are not belonging to high status, they have to do a part-time job and part-time jobs are really necessary for them to continue their studies or anything in their life.  To complete their mission no matter in the field of student or anything else, they have to do jobs.  Just to complete their expenditures and their expenses.  But it also affects on the mind of a person because it may rise some conflicts in someone's brain that why does he has to do the job by -- 
As per my opinion, doing part-time job in foreign country it is fruitful to do because it gives some financial aid and also enhance the cultural information about people of that country.  Doing part-time job is very useful in improving the language skills.  It helps to improve the accent and getting better knowledge about their social values and their customs as well.  It helps to improve the accent also.  So if a student is studying abroad and doing part-time job, he or she can get more knowledge about the history and culture of that country from local people.

I think it's important for some students who has not enough money to complete their education.  These kind of students like to save money for their important need.  For example, there are some students who can't – who can't be at their – their needs and they – so for the important and fundamental needs such as their textbooks and their fee.  And some students also get some benefits of working, teach students about responsibilities, and I think they become mature after getting job, part-time job and responsible, and they also learn some management skills and I think they try to handle different kind of people also.  They – they do some experience.  Students who – who do part-time jobs, I think they also suffer on some extent.  They have...
Of course, it's a good thing for a student to have a part-time job.  First of all, in my opinion student will be able to fulfill his expenditures and in some cases, he or she would be able to support his or her family to some extent.  It will decrease the burden of parents; second, it will add to the student experience and managing skill in life.  That leads to increased confidence level of the student  --  it increase the confident levels of student and part-time job also helpful in developing better economic condition.  Student learn many new things which they cannot learn from the books in schools.  It's helpful in practical life.  Students come to know about the importance of time.  He also learn to balance between jobs and study.  He also learn to manage between money and time and how to manage between college and -- 
Yes, I think it's very important.  If you start part-time job with your studies, it would be helpful for you in economic point of view as well as ability testing.  It means that you will be able to do job with the studies more effectively because you would be experience and experience always does measure on your job.  There might be – this – this might be difficult for you – for you to handle this hectic routine.  But I think the routine will help you to be more active.  Another aspect of your part-time job is that there would be no burden on your parents and as well as you – you become a bit social because of dealing with people at the student level, at a very early age of years and that you will, you know, how to deal with customers, how to deal with different kind of people.

Taking on a part-time job while pursuing a degree is hard work.  But the benefits are actually greater than the amount of a paycheck.  Students who work during their career may have better time management skills than their counterparts.  They must understand responsibility and apply it on their daily life.  They can money  --  they can earn money that can be used for fun or for tuition while gaining some experience in the workplace that will be attractive to the future employees after graduation.  The extra cash from the part-time work life will cover the cost of living more comfortable.  Simply put students who hold down part-time job will have more money than they would have otherwise.

Part-time job is not beneficial for student during their study period because it is the most waste of time.  Basically, it depends on student economic – economical and social status.  These student – those students who have studies but with this and they cannot pay more attention on their studies.  Due to this, they have to face many difficulties to make the balance of time between the study and job.  But it is favorable for low financial year student who sacrifice their studies for their low economic conditions.  And they will not reach on their – on their destination due to their low study.  So some extent it's relevant in student part-time job during study are those who have not financially enough to pay the dues and some extent it's not beneficial.  So it's very difficult...
I believe that as long as the work doesn't significantly affect the student's grade, it is a good idea to work.  Working isn't bad and part-time job for a student I think nowadays, it's really compulsorily.  Well, the most important reason for my opinion is that when you are working outside of a school, a teenager, if you are working as a teenager and it's a part-time job, it gives you more exposure, to the society, to the people around, how you deal with them and all.  So exposure is really necessary and it – it helps in building confidence and the next – and the most essential thing is that while when you are working while studying it allows the student to be more independent right.  So instead of begging pocket money for your parents he is like kind – kind of independent.  So the working is really important and necessary unless or until it doesn't affect the grade.  So when a teen – teenager holds a job while studying it also makes them you know, appreciate...
I still talking about the part-time job – job for a hostel – for a college student, I think so everything has its own advantages and disadvantages.  Sometimes it is beneficial or sometimes it is not.  Then, it still talk about like how it is beneficial.  As I live in Pakistan, I will talk about the Pakistani system, Pakistani circumstances.  I think Pakistan, in – in the whole family, the whole Pakistani family system only a father is the earning source and the whole family sit and eat only.  So if a student have a part-time job – job basic like he will independent, he will manage his own – his own sources, his own expenditures, he will manage himself, he will be independent.  But if you talk about its disadvantages there it also have some kind of disadvantages like it maybe effect the study of the students, maybe effect on the health of a student.  Maybe, his health will be definite...

My answer would be neutral.  A person who does job for two reasons for earning or to get some experience for further career opportunities.  A part-time job is also true for  --  it's also for two reasons.  When a person does job they don't have much resources to survive.  In order to survive, they do part-time job along with their studies.  It's good for them.  Secondly, if a person does not have [***] and have poor financial conditions, they do part-time jobs along with their studies.  As everything has positive and negative impacts, part-time jobs also have some positive and negative effects as well.  Positive in the sense if a person tends to have experience or as well along with studies.  In a different group -- 
In the society in which we are living, it's very tough job to continue a part-time job along with our studies.  So a –a student can detract from its way and from its goals, and he can't continue studies and jobs along each other and there must be some – a lot of hardships he has to bear.  He can't concentrate on his studies and nor on his job and he can never be a proficient student, can never be a proficient employee and the system in which we are studying is very tough type.  It's more theoretical than practical.

Because after completing my degree, I am going to do something with myself actually and I am going to earn money for my family sake, for my sake because it is very important and I think it is quite interesting to know that in our country it is not a basic trend but in Europe countries or other foreign countries...
Part-time job is not beneficial for students.  It can be the wastage of time for students.  It – it is the reason – it is – it cause attention diversion for students.  Student – their attention from studies can be diverted.  They can pay full attention to their studies.  I am totally disagree with this part-time job.  Students cannot pay attention towards their studies.  It can be good for those who can't afford their studies, who cannot have financial support from their parents, they can do job, part-time to support themselves.  And they also – students also can get experience from this – this job.
Definitely I agree with the part-time job because it's the best way to know about the people, their behavior, how to deal with them.  Basically, I belong to lower class family.  Part-time job is the best way to support our parents also and they get able to become independent.  In my country Pakistan, there is no trend of part-time job.  There is problem and that is our parents never allow them because they are not aware of it.  But in foreign countries, there is a common trend about part-time job.  I wish everyone could grab this opportunity of part-time job.  So we can aware about the world also.  They will be support of our country because every person become independent.  They come to know about the difficulties and suffering and how to deal with them with confidence.  Earn the money...
Yes, I agree with this topic that college students should have a part-time job because I think that's the age when they grow – they are growing up and growing to be mature.  So they should learn how to have a career, how to make their career, how to make a life in which they can have a job, have a career and how they can earn their livelihood.  They should – that's – part-time job that is kind of their practice for job.  They can earn and they can study at the same time, but they should learn how to manage their timing for their studies and for both the job – both the activities.  And I think that's really important for the students because this can also help them to, you know, help – this can also help them earn a livelihood as well as this can support in their studies and their financial careers and they...

According to my opinion, part-time job is some extent to beneficial for students.  I also have had bad impact on student's educational careers.  It has many advantages and disadvantages.  It is beneficial for those students who belongs to poor family and their parents cannot afford their educational charges.  Part-time job will help them having experience for their future life, help them raise their confidence to face the hardship of life.  On the other hand part-time job can also help students to financially support their family.  If there are some financial problems in their families, they earn  --  they earn money themselves and fulfill their academic dues.  It is also provide an edge for professional life.

According to my point of view, right, part-time job – part-time job is difficult for this – part-time job is difficult for the students who are in college should not have enough time to do this.  They cannot do study and pass – and part-time job at – at the same time.  We cannot concentrate on a study.  There is a benefit of part-time job as well.  A person becomes social active, he learns how to deal with people and in practical life – in practical life he learns – the constraint part-time job...
Yes, I agree with the statement that students who are going to college they should have a part-time job.  The reason is that that they should go for that because it makes them independent and lower that – it's lessen the burden of parents.  They don't need to pay for them.  It makes them independent, it makes them confident, it makes them how to deal with the social problems and all that.  So I think if you are going to college and if you are having a job, that's – that's a great combination ever students can get many year.  And – and that's all, so I did think because of being a college student and having a job is something that is excited us to because when you are at the college and when you don't have a job that's the biggest problem that we free – when we get free from the college or when we free – when we get free from the universities.  So I think it's a better option like having a job while having the college.
Yes, the first question is that smoking and that part-time job is, uh, good for the students or not.  So, I think it is not good for students, um, because, uh – um, um, because the students have to do a number of things besides the, uh, studying.  And, uh, if they are indulge in doing jobs it gets their – their time wasted and they do not, uh, find, uh, proper time for study.  And, they also, um, uh, they are fed up, uh, they are tied, they, uh, cannot study properly.  But, it can also helpful if they are, uh, doing, um – if they, uh, study and they do job related to their field or their work, if they are students of economics, um, and the teaching the student of economics, it will be helpful for them because by doing this they will get more experience in their field.  So, just...
Actually, there are many, um, uh, many students which are doing the part-time jobs rather than studying.  And, uh, um, uh, many students are facing problem but, uh, to some extent this is important for them like by, um, uh, by doing the important jobs, uh, within the study, uh, they increase their earning and, uh, they, um, uh – and they get the new experiences, development of the skills and at the same time they can relieve the burden of their parents.  And, uh, uh, it also helped for itself – uh – it also helped to have the sense of independence like they did not depend on others but they – um – but they themselves – uh – uh – but they themselves, uh, um-hmm, choose their, uh, things and the practical life and, uh, uh, it helps them to know the practical life.  They can acquire more experience – experience part-time job and the chance to get aware about the different behaviors and people and, uh, other – uh, but it is also difficult for them to maintaining the job and studying at the same...
Uh, I, uh, strongly agree, uh, uh, from this statement.  Actually, uh, job, uh, is a really good option for students, um, uh, on one side because, um, they got a lot of experience from, uh, the job.  Uh.  From – uh – from the part-time job and the – they can experience a party – uh – their practical life.  Uh.  I mean when you go for a job and – and you are still a student you, uh, get, uh, your experience that how you can – uh – when you are in your practical life how you can treat, uh, those people and, uh, when you go for your further job after your – after you complete your studies, you – you get a very good job because you have – you also – you already have your, uh, experience – part-time job experience.  And, there is also a very good reason and for, uh, those students they – this is very good, uh, um, who – who don't have a strong family background because when a student...
Everything has some good and bad effects.  Every action has very – and every choice has some consequences.  They may be in your favor or may not.  Some – so talking about the part-time job of students I will be neutral.  It is good and important sometimes when the student is needy.  He or she has some financial problem.  It will be helpful for him or her and to his or her part – partners as well.  It will be able to continue his or her education.  It will make him independent and also confident.  He will learn soon some, uh; he will learn soon how to face the world and will get the experience how to tackle the problem...
I think part-time job recently became rather popular among the students.  It can make them raise, uh, more additional money in order to fulfill, uh, the need for something.  And, uh, part-time job is also helpful, uh, for the students.  It's, um, uh, also helpful for the students to, uh, start to learn about the working atmospheres where there are so many adult persons, uh, as their partner, which is very difficult, uh, from the world.  And, it helps the students, uh, to, uh, live an independent life.  It helps the students to learn about, uh, uh, their practical life and it helps the students support family.  And, they are able to follow this training without a problem and they can purchase anything they needed.  And, it provides an edge for professional life and it also helps, uh, for those students whose parents cannot earn, uh, money and whose – whose parents cannot fulfill their educational needs.  So, they earn, uh, their money by their self and, uh, fulfill, uh-huh, their educational...
Yeah, I'm totally agree, uh, that the benefits of part-time jobs for students.  Uh, it's actually taking on a part-time job while pursuing a degree is hard work.  But, the benefits are typically greater than the amount of our paycheck.  Students, who work during their college career, may have better time management skills than their counterparts.  They must understand responsibilities and apply it to their daily life.  They earn money that can be used for fun or for tuition while gaining experience in the workplace that will be attractive to future employers after graduation.  Simply put, umm-hmm, students who hold down part-time jobs will have more money than they – that would have otherwise.  As they come into adulthood, earning an income can boost their confidence and allow them to have some fun within the limit of their paycheck.  Some students need to work on through school to afford tuitions and – uh – and in colleges others will set the money aside to paycheck student's loan still the money will be...
According to my opinion, yes, work is needed.  But, in part-time job one can focus on more than one issue at the same time.  College is about learning how to study and take tests and prepare, uh, and, uh, learn techniques.  But, work is about learning how to apply your techniques, your study, uh, and, uh, to know your ability and work ethics.  Part-time jobs build students for their practical life.  They teaches us – uh, they teaches students, um, how to interact with different people, uh, of different nature and, uh, our social network is, uh, increased by interaction, uh, by interaction with different peoples.  Uh, they also, uh, part-time job also helped students in communicate – in developing communication skills and they are a, um, powerful problem solving...
Yes, it is important sometimes to get a part-time job while studying, while education.  But, it all depends upon the – one – uh, uh, economic and social conditions of any specific person.  If one is well and good with its economic conditions and one really can afford all this stuff that he can study, he can only study except any part-time job then he should study.  But, if one's economic conditions doesn't allow him to get a part of, uh – to work – uh, to educate himself without a part-time job then he should have – and – uh, uh, he should have a part-time job to continue his education and to, uh – and to make – uh, and to make it up to the next level.  Uh, there are certain benefits, there are certain disadvantages of this as well.  If you get a part-time job you get a professional – you get your – yourself, uh, as a professional attitude.  You get yourself a – a number of skills.  You get about – you get visibility about how the world goes.
Yes, part-time job for students is better because they can earn money as well as experience and they can see the difficulties, uh, which they have to face in the future.  If a student has a good way and responsible, uh, then the part-time job is good.  But, the student who is careless and has no desire to do, uh, well in the school, uh, will use part-time job as an – another excuse so it's all about the time management.  And, it also really depends upon the students.  Uh, um, but it is their responsibility.  I am not saying that, uh, you have to work for the 40 hours a week in a factory, but spending 20 hours or less and after the schooling on weekends would make, uh, themselves realize the importance of things.  Also that, uh, money doesn't grow on trees and – and how hard it is to buy things you want on a budget.  And, uh, having a good job teach you the critical thinking, uh, critical skills, values of hard work, how to communicate with the other people in the society, uh, how to manage the...
Education is the basic right of everyone.  One should also do part-time job if this need increases.  But, he must prefer the education first.  Part-time job is necessary for those who are not financially strong, who cannot afford their education.  So, they should do the part-time job.  It will increase their experiences in the life and lessen the problems in their economics.  But, it is not good for the brilliant student because they waste their time in this activity and don't focus on their study.  Um.  So, part-time job activity is helpful for the students who are economically...
Um, uh, uh, part-time job is somehow important for the student and somehow it's, uh – it's misleading the students.  As well as there are some of the students in Pakistan mostly belong to the middle class family.  They have to support their family.  Either, uh, they will continue their study or they do it for the job.  And, the education is much more – much, much important for the students but then also, uh, um, uh, uh, part-time job is, uh, uh, important, uh, in such a way that the people who want to – belong to their, uh – who want to support their family, it's important for them.  And, uh, it is very confidential for the – some of the students.  It bring, uh, uh, uh, part-time job brings confidence to the students.  They get confidence to, uh, uh, sort of move in the society practically and, uh – but – but education is the...
It's a contradictory statement.  Some say part-time job is, uh, good but others say it's not good.  But, according to my opinion, uh, it is good for the students because, uh, the students, uh – some students are needy.  Their parents cannot afford their – uh, curricular circumstances.  They can't afford their field and that's why they are doing a part-time job to fulfill their economic, uh, needs.  Uh, yes it's have also some disadvantages.  While doing part-time jobs, a person cannot give full concentration to his studies.  He can, uh, not, uh – uh, he cannot study, uh, uh, with a complete mind.  Uh.  He have to do some part-time job that's why he's not doing his, uh, study properly.  He can't concentrate on his studies.  Uh, once he is thinking about, uh, his job, another time he is thinking about his study.  But, uh, it is also good, uh, because it give us money and it give us, uh, some...
According to me, I strongly agree with that.  If you are a middle – if you are from middle class family now, uh, this is very good for you to do a part-time job for your parents, for your brothers.  You should not be burden on them.  You could do it easily if you have some kind of knowledge.  That if you have knowledge that's good for you.  You can do your job according to yourself.  A job is very good for you.  You can, uh – uh, by doing this job – part-time job you can increase your, uh, experience and knowledge.  By that, you are good for yourself and that is also good for you.  That's why I can agree with that, uh, doing a part-time job can increase your – increase your, uh, experience because in the practical life the, uh, part-time job is very good for you and if you are best very good for you and part-time job can bring...
Part-time, uh – I think part-time job it's a, uh, person and whether he wants to do or not.  Uh, according to my point of view I think, uh, it is not possible for a student to do part-time and study as well because it take a lot of time and consumption of time.  You will not manage, uh, your studies and, uh, job properly.  And, it, uh – it is a burden on you and you cannot do both the things at the same time.  If it is necessary you are financially not strong and you can do that and you may manage and it will give you experience.  You will learn from – you will learn a lot from it and you deliver the lecture and learn from the students as well.  Uh, as I mentioned it earlier so it's up to a person that, uh, what he wants to do, uh, if – according to me I think it is not possible for...
According to my point of view right now, part-time job – part-time job is difficult for this – part-time job is difficult for the students who are in college should not have enough time to do this.  He cannot do study and part – and part-time job at, uh – at the same time.  He cannot concentrate on his study.  There is a benefit of part-time job as well.  A person becomes socially active and learns how to deal with people.  And, uh, in practical life – and in practical life, um, learns, uh, uh, because student – part-time job...
It is not necessary for the college students to do a part time job because all depends on the family whether the family is strong enough to bear the responsibilities, to bear the expenses besides is low paid so it is difficult for the family to manage all such things, so the students are forced to do part time job because students have to do two tasks at a time.  First, they have to study; second, they have to work so in order to maintain both two tasks at a time, it is very difficult for them to indulge in these activities because studying at college is not an easy option so for passing the ex – college students have to really work hard and in order to show good performance.
No, it is, uh, uh, students should not do, uh, this job – uh, this part-time job during the studies because, uh, it can upset the – badly, uh,  first of all their studies, their, uh, own study because I mean they will not have enough time, uh, to, uh, to prepare for this, um, exam for their some, uh, I mean, uh, there are many, uh, things they don't – they don't, uh, don't do perfectly.  They are not having time.  It is also wasting of time really.  Instead of doing part-time job they can do, uh, work.  They can do, uh – pay attention on their own studies.  It can also affect their health because the health is major part for students and, uh, if the person is not healthy how can he study.  And, uh, uh, he will not get high marks, uh, and he – he will not be on merit if he wants to, uh...
It is important I think for college students to have part time job because if they indulge in any kind of part time job, they can use their time in better way instead of indulging in some, you know, harmless activities and they can use their time for their benefit, especially those students who are needy and the – they don't have some specific financial resources to support their studies.  It is important for them and they must have some part time job and for those students who don't have any financial problem and they can continue their studies without part time job, I think they don't have any need to do part time job because if they do part time job so their – their time for the studies will not be appropriate for them and they will be make up time for them to devote to their studies thus their study will suffer though some students are you know very...
Actually, I'm not in complete favor of it nor against this part time job because at certain time it is the need of every man to do part time job because of unemployment in our country and there are many much expenses that the parents can't – can't afford and students have to take steps towards these activities either to release their tension or for time pass or to fulfill their expenses but I think that negative aspects of have part time job are that student's attention will be divert.  They either focus on their studies or on their job so it is a – really have part time job because students may lose interest in their studies and just they want to fulfill their expenses or to release the tension of their parents so it is the...
I disagreed with this statement that it is important for the students to take part in a – their part time jobs during their college.  I think that it has negative effects on their performances, their grading, and it affects the student's ability to concentrate on their homework and the student have – they do not have enough time to sleep and remain tired and it may cause fatigue and this fatigue may affect their exam performance and their grades so they may get poor grades in their studies during college, and I also think that they – they work irregular hours – for the irregular hours and working in the irregular hours if we just try the students good study habit but I think they should drop and it also...
As we see nowadays part time job has become necessary for mostly students because students are unable to fulfill their basic needs of their life.  They can't fulfill their needs and basic – basic needs.  I have an example.  One of my friend, she does part time job with her study because she – she cannot fulfill their study expenditures as she does this job – this – this job and pay her semester fee for her bright – bright future.  No doubt it is very tough for our student give time his job with his study as...
No, I don't agree with you because I – because it affects the student's health mentally and physically because he can't understand, he can't concentrate on his studies.  He always pays his attention on the ways by choosing which he can earn a lot of money, accept it due to a lot of poverty in Pakistan.  Every parts [***], every parents want some money from their children but if they start earning in that age which is their study age or which is their gaining knowledge age, they can't concentrate on their studies – they can't – can't concentrate on their studies as a result the failures become.  This is a main reason of failure in Pakistan, so I can't disagree – can't agree.
The part time job, the effect of part time job on – on student's life is very – is very harm – is very harmful because somewhat it has got affected on their life.  Students are a regular – are regular workers because some of – some marginal [***] reasons.  They work or they are heavily and – heavily – heavily worked – and heavily worked on their – on their study – on – on their – on – on their study because the studies – studies are import – important than job – than job.  The – some heavily – heavy burden of your – some heavily burdened of their study on the work those students are de-motivate of their job so – so like to be – so like – so like to be very – very [***] student affected.  They are maybe differ for between the perception of those [***] and outcomes that will demonstrated in more...
Yes, it is important to have a part time job – part time job by the college student these days because it is not only essential for their independence level but also feels that decrease their burden on their parents.  If the students will improve their pay lev – payment – pay level then definitely they will improve their confidence level as well.  They will not be dependent anymore to their parents and it will create them a satisfaction level and a creativity, a courageous level and optimistic level to them and if it will not be helpful – it will not be helpful – not only helpful in this increasement [***] of the satisfaction level but definitely the students will be much more specific towards the – towards their goals and aims so the need for the...
Yes, I agree that students should do the part time job.  It is the need of the time because this is a very, very high price time.  Inflation is growing day by day and we have to become the arm of our parents instead of asking them that we need our fees, we need our money for our expenses and this is our need, please provide us the financial assistance, this and that.  This is not a good job.  We should – students should do their part time job with their studies so that they can got the experience, they can got – fulfill their own – own requirements as its own and they will not be dependent on anyone else and this will really help our society.  It will...
The – they can get the extra – extra spending money they can get and they can value the money.  College students might also work their part time job to help pay for tuition and room and board and they can fulfill their needs – personal needs.  College students often work in dining hall or deliver pizzas or they prefer the restaurant near homes or campus and the high school students often work local part time job during the school so they can get extra money, and it helps them to work and help their parents who cannot afford so much – so many amount of their studies so they make their own...
Yes, I think it is important, it is good to do a part time job along with your studies because it can – it can help a person to share the financial burden and it can – for example, there are many public sector and private sector universities [***] themselves and currently studying in a government sector universities – university, there are many day-to-day expenses along with my annual dues which – for which I need money and my – I have a set of amount which I take from my parents and my parents give that money to me every week or every month so – but – but that money, I could not afford to have a luxury kind of lunch or breakfast or any dining with my friends.
Part time guy is – job is very – very interesting and the [***] for the students – students may enjoy this and may trouble [***].  Part time job is the – the problem and the mentality of a student in this way they can do this.  If students enjoy their part time job, it's very beneficial for them so to do the part time job, student can support their family.  They can escape from bad habits.  They can do good – good experience for their future.  It's a good – good experience for them if they do this very carefully.  If students take – a burden...
Hi there!  This is XXX.  I am also a student and I am not in favor of part-time jobs for students as some students have to do some part-time jobs due to their financial condition but its worst effect can also be seen on their health and also on their students.  These students cannot concentrate properly on their studies.  Their attention is also diverted to their jobs.  They do not have enough time to study and also for rest.  The basic reason was that these students are financially weak and sometimes they have to support their families so they start some part-time job.  As a result, they could not properly att  their classes and also cannot give attention to their jobs.  Student life is best for every person, but these students cannot enjoy their student life.    
I think most students try and take work that they can easily fit around their studies.  This usually means shift work such as working in a bar or restaurant, which can be changed around week by week.  Call centers are another popular choice.  Competition for these source or jobs will be high so if you think you will need to work, it is always best to organize a job as soon as possible.  During the holidays, the free hours that you can work are obviously a lot more and this is when most students take on full-time but temporary work in places where they can earn more money such as - such as [Unclear].    
It is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Often students work jobs that introduce them to their preferred career after school is over.  This allows them to again important introductory experience in the business and begin networking with those in that field.  Even students who work in places not connected to their majors will look more impressive to potential employers.  They have some kind of work experience on their resumes to start and fact that they have been able to hold a job while a school attests to their level of maturity, responsibility, and time management employers look for employees.    
I disagree with the statement that college students should be some part-time job when they study at colleges.  This – this disturb not only their health but – but time also and study too.  It stops their mental and – mental and physical growth.  It wasted a lot of their time.  Also, students have to suffer a lot of due to this.  Learning with earning is not doubt a difficult task, and if a student can manage without it should be – should not waste himself in such kind of jobs.  It will pay him a lot and – and he should study and leave all other activity.  I disagree with the statement that college – that college students should be some part – some part-time jobs when they study at college.  This disturb not only their health but time also and study too.    
I think students must have part-time jobs because they have only this option to help their parents financially.  By having these jobs, they can obtain valuable work experience.  It may provide them networking possibilities and help them on a rewarding lifetime career path.  It can provide them constructive use of free time.  They can learn time management.  They can learn good work habits.  They can develop their confidence and self-responsibility.  They learn how they have to behave as an indep ent, but at the same time, the students with these jobs can have some drawbacks like less time for homework, like low grades in their studies, like stress on their mind, and they may have problem in balancing work and studies, which may prove factor for them.    
Yes, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because today the cost of life has gone very high as far as day-to-day using and expenses are concerned.  Mostly students belong to middle class and lower middle and poor families, and their families are unable to support them at all levels.  So, in order to lessen their family burden and to become self-dep ent, it is essential to have a part-time job, but one thing must be kept in mind that first thing is the study and then comes the job, so time management should be entertained.  Studies and job are focused in such a way that neither of the two should be affected by one another.  And all this is possible when the students get determined that they will keep pace with both these jobs.  They must also try to support their family but if it is impossible…    
It is not important for college students to have part-time jobs because they cannot manage both college and jobs.  They cannot give proper time to their studies.  If they started to have part-time jobs, they cannot get good grades and their studies will be affected from their jobs.  If first time they go for studies and second time they go for jobs, their health will be down as we know a healthy body has a healthy mind, so that they cannot concentrate on their studies.  So, students should avoid part-time jobs.  First, they should complete their studies and after that think about job.    
I – I think it is not justice to be - to do some job with the study, but now with the - there is inflation all around and the expenses of college have gone sky high.  It becomes difficult to meet body and soul together we can say for study.  So if a student learn and earn simultaneously, he is facing great difficulty but even them - then he is doing very good.  He is sharing the burden of his family.  He can support his family members also.  This is an important economic support from his - if his studies are not disturbed at all, but he should spare some time for the studies.  It becomes difficulty to meet body and soul together we can say for studies.  So, if a student learns and earns simultaneously, he is facing…    
It is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I – I do not agree with this statement because college students are very - are not interested in their jobs because there are categories of students.  Some students are interested in jobs and some are not interested in job and some are belong to high status and some are belong to low status, so that the students of low status they have to – they have to part – they have to take part-time job because according to - according to fulfill their needs and needs of studying - studying, they have to – they have to take a job, so that the students of high status cannot interested in job because they fulfill their needs fully because they have - because they get the support of their student – of their parents.  And…    
Part-time jobs are not good for the students because these jobs engage a lot of time and hard work and that way it's affected.  The work – the students have to work really hard on this job and they have to – they don't know how to manage time.  Where they get free time they have to study and they do not study well because they are – they really – because they are really lazy at that time.  They have to – they are not – they didn't know how to focus on the studies because they are – that because the – because their time is not – because the time is engaged in that job, then they don't know – they will keep on thinking about the job that how they can – they will manage their time – family and the how the job – the how – will – they will get ready for job and the job and engage a lot of time as they don't know...
Okay.  Like as I said that part-time job is not good for students because they cannot be attention to their studies and their job as well.  It consumes a lot of time which they can – they can serve in studying.  They have to do job and they also do not pay their total attention to job, that is why it is not good for them but it – they do it – students do it just because they have financial crisis.  So if they want to meet their expenses and they have to do any job, so I think it should be related to their field if means – if they are the student of economics and – and – and as economics they are doing.  So they can teach the student of economics.  It's so helpful the students in many ways that they will get great in their subject, in their field and they will also get money.  So according to me if they want to do...
I will not appreciate the students doing part-time job during his studies.  They – they are planning to seek for finances, example, their financial conditions – the financial problems that force students to do a part-time job to complete their studies.  But it has very negative impact on their studies.  They are – they remain worried.  They are full of stress.  There is no balance between their studies and their job.  The routine is rigorous.  They – they are – they lose their good health and they remain worried most of the time.  This is due to their problems.  But there is still we can see a few advantages of a part-time job due to which they can form the skills of management and financial problems which can help in their later life.  But doing part-time jobs...
Working while studying allow the student to be more independent instead of begging for pocket money for their parents.  I think these days many teenager who go to school or university also work.  It might be the odd weekend bargaining job or it can be a part-time daily job.  Working wise, training a lot of student to be more independent, instead of begging for pocket money for their parents, the student can easily earn money and spend it as they want.  When teenager hold a job while studying, it also make them appreciated the volume of money.  The most important reason of my opinion is that holding a job outside of school or college, give the student exposure.  Student lives a very secured lifestyle while they are at school and college.  Working while studying allow the...
The part-time job can also give the self-confident to the student.  Somehow because they prepare themselves for the future and they get exposure for doing more better thing, doing the part-time job during their studies.  But otherwise it's bad – otherwise it's bad – it has – it – it has impact [***] on the student because their study affect kids through their part-time working but in the working [***] mostly the students have to do their part-time job and they have to do a lot of work and they even don't get a handsome salary.  So, somehow – somehow it is not good for the students.
So part-time jobs are not good for student – college students especially because they are at the level – level of study that they are not very – very hard working and they should do studies when they are involved in studies.  They shouldn't do any part-time jobs because it would take a lot of energy, lot of time, and they won't be able to study it during that time.  They will do some physically and mentally tired and when a person is physically tired, he automatically become mentally tired and in tiredness a person is not able to study.  So a student, college student would – won't get any good grade – at least he won't get any good grades and the – purpose of study is only to have good grade and good results and when he do part-time jobs, he is not able to focus on his studies well to get proper grades.  So...
While doing a part-time job, a student expect that it is – it will be useful for him but when the grade effect badly – effect badly then he – then the job is really disappointed him.  The student became confuse what to do or what to do not.  The main reason for student to do a part-time job is the – is the education who become really expensive and I have some solution for this problem.  First, he – the government should support these students who are intelligent, hardworking and have good academic record.  Secondly, government should introduce some scholarship program in this regard so that no student face problems during his studies.  Thirdly, education should be the first priority of any...

Part-time jobs are very much important for the students of colleges because these – these help – these help them to increase confidence and these help – give them confidence that they can do anything and they can earn money along with their studies.  By the help of these jobs the – the students also remain away from the useless activities as well.

So they spend whole day with their studies and then with their jobs and these jobs are, for instance, of good hard worker men.  And hotel jobs and home...
Employers offer the graduates with some prior working experience of a fresh candidate as they will be more effective in less time.  Part-time job can be more effective as these are related to student's area of studies as every – as everything cannot be taught through theory and a real world implementation of the concepts can make a huge difference in terms of learning.  Students who are less fortunate in terms of financial stability can use part-time jobs to continue their studies.  Getting – getting a quality education requires more financial resources which are out of reach for – for many.  Although, in some cases, people with part-time jobs tend to be very weak in studies and cannot secure good grades which will affect their education but after a period in the year from parents and teacher can help those individual.

They are – there also some students – sometimes sort of responsive – responsibility among students.  And it is the most important and – and they have a good time for their future.

The students who are doing part-time job, they have to make some – some shortcomings.  There are some experience by doing part-time job.  Students have to work hard more.  Some students can't manage their studies with their job and their minds are not free and they have to work hard and after working, they have to continue their studies.  In this way they can't properly sleep which can affect on their physical health.  They have a lot of burden on their minds so that they have to meet mentally problems.  Even if they can't good – even if they can't good – they can get good results and their grades are – their grades are not according to their expectations, they lose their hope.

They try to build their confidence and – and polish their qualities.

It is a good idea for students to have part-time job.  Before getting a job everyone need to try, experience.  In fact, this is the best period to human life to observe knowledge and learn experience.  For some reason, I think students should take part-time job.  One reason is that student can get experience and student will learn to study behavior of human with experience.  In addition when doing a part-time job, student can practice the lesson got from class as practical.  Knowledge got from teacher I think never enough and never fulfilled your needs.  It's just theoretical work.  When you go enjoy field, you can do the practical and you do the practical and so their class experience change into practical.  One student doing practice time, practical work and do job, they earn money by their own...
Part-time job is helpful for students, the students who do not have family support financially and socially but they keen to study.  For the fulfillment of their expenditure, they have to do part-time job.  They have to face bitter realities and hardships of life.  They can face any hurdle while [***].  There are some demerits as well.  It is time consuming.  Students cannot give proper time to their study, it demand work hard and students suffer a lot.  It affects them mentally as well as physically.  Students who do part-time job and get education, they should manage their time.  Good management leads to success.  They have to – they can face any hurdle while [***] to support their family as well.  These jobs enable them to take the field.  It's...
Nowadays more and more students decide to have a part-time job during their study in colleges.  Part-time job has both merits and demerits.  Part-time job makes students much more financially independent.  It can relieve student's financially burden.  They take part-time job to pay their tuition and cost of living.  Part-time job can be more effective if they are related to the students and their studies.  By taking the part-time job the students can gain – gain access to new experience and new friends.  Additionally, taking the part-time job is beneficial to the cultivation of independence and sense of responsibility.  All in all, you can say that by taking the part-time job is beneficial to the students.  Also, however, it also has negative effects on students, several reasons.  First of all, by taking the part-time job students can't get their studies and certain drawback is that student's health will be affected while they – they do part-time job.  For instance some jobs start at the early morning and finish late at night.  It means that there were...
Only it is very good approach that students doing job with their studies, some students do job for only that they want to face the society as well as the world and they want to practice – the practical life and they want the job – they want to do job to improve themselves.  They want to improve that they have the qualities of doing job and study together.  They want to show people that – that they have the capability of management and they manage both things together.  They improve that thing that he can manage all the things with – with together and do all the things in this world.  There is nothing that they cannot do.  They improve himself...
As I said that I am agree with this topic that student must do part-time job.  There are many advantages of this.  The first advantage is that the students will get practice, you know, in study students study always theory, theoretical.  By doing a job, they will get practice.  They will become more expert in their field because it is necessary for to be expert in their field because in the future they have to do, perform.  They have to perform different duties.  They have to become a constructor in their mission.  Students will be active.  They do not build the passive by doing job and further advantage is that they will not indulge in activities which are not good for students.  They will not get enough time to do bad things and that is why it is good for them.  Obviously, there are negative impact that maybe it is also pressurize for student.  They will  --  it's very hectic for student but after sometime if student study and their job -- 
The part-time job has the advantages as well as disadvantage.  You got – at least part-time job do have – do have experience.  And those students will get experience with their part-time job but it is effect [***] effect studies.  They cannot pay attention to their studies and their – their job at the same time and they suffer – they – they get – they are – they became – they also became and they can know the [***] two – two things at the same time and this is a – this is a burden for them.  And so there are – there are some advantages of it.  They have the experience for the future – for the future and [***]...
Well, I think part-time job is good as well as bad for a student.  Good in the  --  in the sense that with part-time job students can get more confidence and can manage their time more skillfully than other students.  Part-time job also provides students experience in other fields like if they are doing a job at a  --  at a hotel as a waiter or at high school as a teacher, they will have more confidence than other students.  On the other hand, it is also bad because sometimes these jobs affect student physical and mental health.  They cannot concentrate on their studies.  Sometimes the person they cannot get time for sleep and also a bit benefit of part-time job is that you will learn how to manage your money at college or university level.  Students are often get fearless about money and their spending on wasting money because they are just getting it from parents.  So part-time jobs will also enhance -- 
Yes, it is the major theme.  The part-time job is necessarily important for the student as well and the main advantages for example, they can support their family.  They can support themselves and – and they know how to manage their time, how to manage their abilities, to use their abilities in the best way and they can – will have – will utilize the time in the best – the best – in the best manner and they can enhance their professional skills and practical and it will always help in the practical life and when they will start their job by completing their degree, it will help them and will also add to enhance their abilities to manage their time and we will not use badly the time...
No, I am not agree with that, the student should have the part-time job because basically it is a waste of the time for some students.  Student cannot pay attention on the – on their study according to the time and – and they may be a mentally victim of – mentally tensions and he maybe a panic for this condition to not give attention to their studies and therefore it – it may be – it may be a disagreement for their parents and for their career and maybe student get not good marks after doing their work and – because they may be tired up after doing some time.  Therefore, he cannot pay attention on their study and it's basically I am not agree with that that the student maybe.  Student may – may should not be have a part-time...
Whether students can go for the part-time jobs depends totally on the mode of education.  Some countries want the student to be for the 2 day in schools and colleges and some – in countries they taught for some time and leave them free to do have their college.  So students in such countries can go for part-time job and students attending full day course, it is not possible to go for you.  But only in the summer you will have plenty time – plenty of time for a job career when you are – when you are an adult.  Right now, you should be taking advantage of many school activities offered to you.  If you have a specific career in mind, then seek a volunteer position in the field.  So you can learn about the career and if it is something you might really want to pursue develop your interest and ability now.  Work for money later, stress...
Student who do the part-time job take – in my point of view, they cannot balance the college work and office work.  I felt that the students also influenced by the part-time job.  I think it is important sometimes for some students who need money.  But all students cannot because a lot of work as they have to do the college work and part-time job office work.  So they cannot handle the burden.  It is not – it is easy to balance the two things in one time, a brain cannot handle two thing – two things.  It's important for some students but not all students.  It is important for those students who have a problem of some kind of money problems to complete their education.  These kind of student like to save the money for their important or other kind of the settlement...
I was telling you about that it varies from person to person.  Some people have to do a job and some people don't want to do a job.  And if someone is doing a part-time job, that means he is trying to meet the expenditure he has and for meeting those expenditures, he or she has to do a job and this part-time job may affect his physical output in his studies.  Because when you are doing a job or any physical activity, your brain is continue to work again and again and you can have a better efficient brain, but it also reduces the time you are giving to the studies.  The time you have to give  --  give to the studies, you will -- 
Part-time job is not necessary for a student but if he has – if he has no financial problem.  But if there is a student who cannot pay his tuition fees and he or she should get a part-time job because it will help him or her to carry on his further education.  Part-time job in foreign countries is good because – and through this, student can get more knowledge about their culture, about their social values and – and also about their accent.  He can learn communicative skills through them and it also helps to improve the – getting better knowledge about their social values.  So if a student is studying in abroad, he should get as much knowledge as he can.  It improves the communication – communicative skills.  However, if a student is...
I think it's important for some students who has not enough money to complete their education.  But sometimes if this gives benefit, but sometimes it is not as beneficial as – as we can understand.  For example, some students – when some students do part-time job, they don't get proper time for their homework and they can't get proper time for sleep and study and they can't balance the college work and office work.  And I think if a student is doing part-time job with studying I think the result of the student is also influenced by part-time job.  I think it's important sometimes for some students who need it but all students can't bear the double burden because they are doing part-time job and they are also studying.  So they have this double burden, so it's not easy to balance the two.
Yes, of course, I agree with the statement.  It's good for a student to have a part-time job.  It's a good thing and in my opinion student will be able to fulfill his expenses and in some cases he would be able to support his family to some extent.  It will also decrease the burden on his parents, and second it will add to the student experience and managing skill in life.  That leads to increase confidence level of student.  It increase confident level and he also comes to know how to manage between college and job and part-time job also helpful in developing better economic condition.  And he also learn new things which they cannot learn from books in school.  And I don't think that part-time job detracts students from study but this thing depend upon student attitude and student begins to have full risk than his parents...
Yes, it think it's very important.  If you start part-time job with your studies, it would be helpful for you in economic point of view as well as ability testing.  And there would be no burden on the parents and you become fresh, a bit fresher because of dealing with people at very early age and personally you should feel that you are independent and you are not burden on your parents.  You will be able to manage your time according to your situation, according to, you know, how to deal with time and how to – how to handle the hectic routine.  But I think this is – this routine will happen to be more active and, you know, it – it – it means that you will be able to do job of the study more effectively and you would be able – because you would be experience and experience always does matter.  And if you say that in negative aspect of this part-time job, the part-time job is not beneficial during...
Student taking on a job on top of their studies will have less free time than non-working students.  Simply put, students who hold down part-time job will have more money than they would have otherwise.  As they come into adulthood earnings and income can boost their confidence and allow them to have some fun within the limits of their paychecks.  Some students need to work through a school to afford tuition.  Students earning their own money get lesson on spending wisely.  Taking on a part-time job while pursuing a degree is hard-work but the benefits are typically greater than the amount of paycheck.  Student who work during their careers may have better time management skills than their counterpart.  They must understood responsibilities and apply...
Well, it is the favorable for low financial student who sacrifice their study because of their economic condition, low economic condition.  They will not reach on their destination due to the low – lower economic financially.  So their – their study is not enough to complete – to compete the other student to reach their destination.  Part-time job is not beneficial for student during their study period because it's the most waste of time.  Basically, it depends on the student economic and financial conditions of who have not – who students have – does not have enough to pay the dues, they can be part-time job but it is the very difficult to maintain the balance between time and study.  It cannot made for more attention on their study.  Due to this they have to face many difficulties...
Well, if your grades don't affect your – if your money, oh sorry.  If your work doesn't affect your grades, then I don't think that there is something bad about working.  So – and you know we should work because the most important thing is that the student gets independent and he knows the value of money.  And – and the reason for my opinion is that holding a job outside of a school gives the student an exposure and students lead a very sheltered lifestyle while they are at school and college and when they are let out into the world, suddenly they feel insecure and that's how they understand what society is, what the people around them are.  And when a teenager holds a job while studying, it also makes them appreciate the value of money.  Many teenagers they spend their pocket-money rashly without a second.  But when they earn, they know to spend each and every penny.  So, in my opinion, allowing teenagers to hold a job while studying is great like – unless or until it doesn't affect...
As I already have said that everything has its own advantages and disadvantages.  So part-time job also has some kind of advantages and disadvantages.  Everybody has his own point of view.  If you are talking about its benefit, it is also beneficial for us.  In Pakistani system, it's also beneficial for us because – because in Pakistani society and Pakistani customs, it's not – it is not our custom to – to job each and everyone in the house.  Only a father is the earning source.  He earns and the whole family – and the whole family depend on the – depend on only one person and if a student have a part-time job, he will manage his own sources, his own expenditure, he will manage all that, what is his expenditures.  If you talk about its disadvantages, it maybe effect the study of a students.  He – maybe he will not get time to – to give – will give more time to his study.  Most of the time he will spend his time to see his job...
As far as some disadvantages are like first it is the lack of time for focusing studies because when students have short time for their studies, for their health, for their activities, – so so if your – if your students are doing part-time job, you have earn money but we have – but student neglect many things for their own self like – like family time, activity time, outing time and only we – students have only one weekend to do – done.  They have lot of work and the second thing – the second thing is advantages of part-time job is if – if students join a part-time job they – they got many experiences behalf of their job and they have – they got many experiences because – before their future experiences and he got how to organize their life and studies and effect...
Part-time job is good for those guys who survive for their own life and for their family.  Part-time job is good because the student move in different places and – and make their contents for survive their life and get achievements in their life very successful.  Well, part-time job is good for – good for those persons who want to – who want to become something – special in business field or social circle because job is the main thing.  A student got experience, connection, social circle wide areas or friends and – a student got – after finishing their study he got some specific experience for the future.  So part – some – in some ways a part-time job is a very good, and in some ways the part-time job is not good but the main course of this is – this is...
A person who does jobs for two reasons, for earning or to get some experience for further career opportunities.  A part-time job is also for two reasons.  A person got part-time jobs to have much resources to survive.  In order to survive they do part-time job along with their studies.  Secondly, if a person does not have strong [***] and  --  and have poor financial conditions, they do part-time jobs with their studies.  As everything has positive and negative impacts, part-time jobs also have some positive and negative impact.  Positive in the sense the person can have experience along with studies.  Different people have enhance his knowledge as  --  as we learn through discussion and with experience.  We learn a lot through this, but it has a negative impact as well.  A person who is having around with part-time jobs disturb his -- 
In Pakistani society, it's very tough for students to carry job  --  part-time job and studies along with each other.  It's really hard for students because he can't pay his full attention towards both of them, and his studies will suffer a lot and there must be a lot of things, events which can come together and he must have to choose one and he has to skip other ones.  There must be some exams.  There must be some important meetings with his boss and whatever and so he can feel a lot of pattern of job and studies on his and so he cannot be proficient enough as -- 
Yes, I agree part-time job is important and it is necessary in the same way.  First of all, it will enhance your hidden skills, your – you have a very good time to spend and your activities will be useful and it will also help your economic career activities and when you will do a job, it will increase your confidence, your hidden skills, your – your artistic and creative skills and it is also – it helps your mental level and it will help to manage your time in the best way and you will know the importance of time.  It will also – will be the first step to your practical life and it will increase your confidence in your next life in the future.  It can also help and...
Yes, I think it is very important for the students to do part-time job because it is a way to do things in our society or to earn money for yourself, for your parent's sake and for your family's sake.  Because it is  --  in my further life when I am graduate or someone, a graduate  --  a student graduate from studies, he should have something that support him, support him in his official life.  I think it is very important for a student to do part-time job because it is quite helpful for him, for his family and other thing.  And in Pakistan, it is quite not that planned out it is in the foreign countries or in European countries because here family support for the student.  Otherwise, not the governmental support but in foreign countries they have support from the government -- 
I am not agree with this statement part-time job is not good for students.  It can be attention diversion for – from their studies.  They can't pay full attention towards their studies.  It can be wastage of time.  Students waste – mostly students do job for their enjoyment, not for experience.  So they can't pay attention towards their studies.  It can be – it cause downfall from their studies.  It can – students can – can get – can pay attention towards their studies.  It is wastage of time but it also good for those who can't afford their studies, who can't pay – who can't pay for their studies – who – who can't get – who can get support – financial support from their parents.
In my country Pakistan, there is no trend of part-time job.  There is a problem and that is our parents never allow them because they are not aware of it.  But in foreign countries, there is a common trend about part-time job.  I wish everyone could get this opportunity of part-time job so that we can aware about the world also.  This will also support our country because every person become independent.  They come to know about the difficulties and suffering and how to deal with the confidence.  Earn the money is not an easy task.  Our parents help them a lot throughout our life.  They support us, encourage them to participate in every field of life.  I want to do a part-time job so that I can help out my parents to – not too much but to some extent.  And I think we – I agree with the part-time job because it's the best way to know about the people, way they live here and how...
I am in support of this cause that student should have a part-time job especially college or university students.  They should have a part-time job.  I think because that's the growing age when you learn to mature and that's the age you – you should know how to earn, you should know how you should prepare or you prepare yourself for your careers and you should start having experience that how you are going to have a career and how you are going to earn for your livelihoods.  That's why one should have a job, a part-time job that will – that will also help you in your financial career and in your studies financially and definitely in your other – in your life financially that will help you and the second most important thing is about the earning part...
Well, generally speaking students can benefit a lot from part-time jobs.  There are many advantages like students can earn money taking a part-time job.  In this point, students can pay a part of their living cost and at the same time relieve their parents' – parents' burden actually.  Some young people have to earn money on their own to pay the tuition while others just earn money to pay for the expenditure or – or satisfying their desire plus another advantage is that students can acquire more experience and polish their skills when taking a part-time job.  For example, if someone enjoys teaching, working part-time as a tutor, may help him or may help him or her improve teaching skills and gain experience.  It's one – one or the other hand, there are many disadvantages too.  First of all, it is like a time for the focus on – focus on studies.  There is a high possibility that – that the students will have trouble finding...
Part-time – time job for university and college students is a good because it's a mean of supporting their expenses by your own self.  There are some families who belongs to a low standard – standard areas, these standard families will do not afford their costly expenses of studying and studies.  So the students have to cut off their studies.  It can be a – mean of earning – mean of earning and mean of – mean of earning to fulfill their expenses and some needs – so there are some students who need tuitions.  But for – for the main job work up for maintaining tuitions is a high cost of the tuition which has risen, so abruptly in recent years.  Teekh hai.  It may be a good source of getting money.  It – it is a good way of – of spending...


As I have already said the part-time job is necessary for students which have financial problems in their homes and the other type of things.  But it has many advantages and disadvantages.  Part-time job, in some are saying – some extent is beneficial for students.  I also had impact – it also have a bad impact on student's educational careers.  But it helps them having new experiences of life.  Help them raising their confidence to face the hardship of life.  On the other hand, part-time job can also help students to financially support their family if there are some financial problem.  So part-time job provides an edge to those students who have financial problems in their homes, in their families and they don't have enough money to pay their fees.  They earn money be – they...
I already say that about your question.  My opinion, students should join a part-time job because it will help them having new experiences for their future, help them raise their confidence to face the hardship of life.  On the other hand, part-time job can also help the student to financial support their family.  If there  --  if there are some financial problems it is  --  it is beneficial for those students who belong to poor family and their parents can -- 
My answer would be neutral.  It can be good in one sense, and it can be bad in other sense.  Person who does a job for two reasons for earning or to get some experiences for further career opportunities.  A part-time job is also for two reasons.  When a person go abroad, they don't have much resources to survive.  In order to survive, they do part-time job along with their studies.  Secondly, if a person doesn't have strong consequences and – and have poor financial conditions, they do part-time jobs along with their studies.  As everything has a positive and negative impact, part-time job also have some positives and some negative impacts as well.  Positive in the sense that a person can have experience along with studies.  We need different people that enhance this knowledge as we learn through discussion and we experience them.  We learn a lot shortly but it...
Part-time job has some advantages and dis – disadvantages.  If you do part-time job, your experience become wider and in professional life you adjust easily without any problem because you already have experience after all.  But it has some disadvantages.  It have – part-time job have some disadvantages like your routine become stop and you feel stressed on your studies and your personal life.  But if you do part-time job your – your confidence level becomes wider and you have idea how you – how we deal with the other people, your interaction with other people become wider and you have good social – if you have good social circumstances, then you shouldn't do part-time job because that – there is another method.  It depends upon your social circumstances.  But some student does not manage job with studies and that is the common fact...
I think a person becomes social active, he learns very well.  He learns how to deal with people.  He meets with people around – around our daily routine.  Part-time job is – I – I think part-time job is difficult for the students who are in college should not have enough time to do this.  They cannot do study, actually cannot do study and part-time job at the same time.  He cannot concentrate on his study perfectly.  This is the benefit of part-time – there is a benefit of part-time job as well.  We can support our family if he – if they – if he have some problem – financial problems as well they maybe can support our family, our other brothers, sis...
Well, to be more explanatory about it, why should I agree with the statement that a student who are going to college they should have a part-time job.  I think just to give opportunity while you are getting education from institution who were practicing at not really or you can say continuously with education and it's a slight  --  where actually you belong, where actually you need to go up to your education.  It's a big therapy if you go through your education and then you decide that you are going to practice it as soon as possible and that is all possible by having a part-time job while having a college.  You became confident, you know how to be in society, you know how to, you know, makes yourself financially strong.  You get to face up in your world.  You get to know what is going to have or actually in a society when you are going to be, you know, be sent to college or universities.  So I think this is a great opportunity if you are having opportunity you know -- 
Uh, the student do part-time job only because they have financial barrier and they want to overcome – they need money for their studies.  So, if there is a mass education or universal education for all students I think they will not get, uh – do a job because they, uh, too know that it is not good for them.  It wastes their time.  They, uh, indulge in doing the activity which required a physical or the mental work, uh, so they get tired.  They cannot study well.  Um.  But again, uh, everything have its pros and cons, um, and if student do job related to their field work they can get advantage.  And, they can get more experience in example like the, uh, in the field area they studied the, uh, the subjects you are studying, if you are going to teach in that particular area, are you going to get practice in that particular area it will obviously benefit for you and you will get experience.
It can be difficult to balance work and school like, uh, the students that, uh, do the part-time job and the, uh, schooling at the same time, they face many difficulties like, uh, uh, it is difficult for them to maintain the job and to study and, uh, they have no more time for the, uh – for to paying attention to their studies.  And, they get the, uh – and they get disturbance, uh, both physically and mentally.  But, so, uh – but there are some also advantages like it is important for them because they get the new experiences in the industry and, uh, they also develop their skills.  At the same time, they can relieve the burden of their parents, uh, and have a sense of independent.  And, it helps to know the practical life.  They can acquire more experience, uh, by the part-time job is a chance to get aware about the different behaviors of the people, and, uh, it helped them to, uh, get aware about the practical life that, uh, what they should do in the past and in future life and, um, they also know...
Yeah, I strongly agree and that, uh, students should – should have, uh, to do, um, uh, job, private job because, uh, when a student, uh, gets, um, uh, um, his study and he also, uh, do a private job with, uh, his study, um, he get a lot of experience.  And, uh, from part-time job, um, uh, they can experience how to survive in a part – in a practical life.  When, uh, you go for a – for a job, uh, after your, um, uh, after your study is complete, uh, uh, you know, you can suffer after those students, uh, who cannot experience the, uh, job.  And, uh, this again also helps those students who don't have strongly, uh – strong, uh, family background and they can help their family.  When, uh, uh, your family – your parents are not rich, uh, and, uh, they – um, the students are, uh, helping the parents to, uh, earn the money and, uh, they can also, um, uh...
Everything has some good and bad effects.  Every action and every choice has some consequences.  They may be in your favor or may not.  So, talking about the part-time job of students I will be neutral.  It has gotten important sometimes when the student is needy.  He or she has some financial problems.  It will be, uh, helpful for him or her and it will be helpful for his or her parents as well.  She or he will be able to continue their education.  It will make him or her independent and also confident.  He will learn soon how to face the world and will get the experience how to tackle the problems of practical life.  On the other hand, uh, it will, uh – it can – it may badly affect his education as it damaged his health as well as he only focuses on work neglecting health and...
I think part-time job recently became rather popular among the students.  It can make them raise more additional money in order to fulfill their need for something.  And, it – it, uh, helps the students, uh, who belong to a poor family and their parents cannot afford their educational needs.  Their parents cannot afford their educational dues.  Uh.  So, they earn money by their self and, uh, fulfill their educational need.  And, part-time, uh, job also has students start to learn about the working atmosphere where there are so many adult persons as their partner, which is very difficult from the world.  It helps the students, uh, from poor family to be able to follow the study without a problem.  They can purchase anything they needed and it provides, uh, an edge from a – for a professional life and it helps the students, uh, to have experience for the part – practical life.  And, uh, they know how to earn a money and how to use it and how to manage, uh, the, uh, uh – their household burden and how to manage their educational burden.  And, uh – it, uh, I think according to me it has, uh...
Uh, you know, uh, students are earning their own money, get lessons on spending wisely.  They may be less likely to spend their hard, uh, earned money frivolously and learn to delay gratifications to pay for necessities such as textbooks and rent.  At the same time, they can save on non-essential purchases such as car.  Students taking on a job on top of their studies will have less free time than non-working students.  When working students have to measure out their time they tend to be better planners, um, and they can sure, uh – they make sure they complete work every task expected of them on deadline.  They learn to weigh their priorities sometimes skipping fun activities to finish their responsibilities.  This prepared, uh, actually them for life after school.  And, uh, uh, you know after college when excuses and, uh, doing work will be frowned upon.  Uh, often students work job that introduced them to their preferred career after school is over and after college is over.
According to my view, yes, work is needed.  A part-time job is needed.  But, in a part-time job one can focus on more than one issue at the same time.  College is about learning how to study and take tests and, uh, learn techniques.  Um.  But, uh, work is about learning how to apply your abilities, and work, uh, ethics and your learnings of, uh, uh, your practical life.  Part-time jobs, uh, build, uh, students for practically and make them strong, uh, uh, and make them sure of their, uh – make them know of their abilities what they have.  Uh.  It also teaches us, uh, students, uh, that, uh, how to interact with different people of different nature in different environments.  And, uh, it – well – it enhanced our problem solving, uh, ability that, uh – in which today – in which situation, uh, how to in – uh...
As such, there are advantages and disadvantages of having a part-time job.  If you do a part-time job you get professional skills, you get attitude, you get how to treat the people in the world.  Uh.  You know how to, uh, uh – you know this is also an education.  This is also a skill which allows you to get into the world.  How people behave in different conditions?  How the economic status of different people?  How the students having a part-time job and how the students with a better economic status who do not need, uh, a part-time job, how they behave differently in different conditions in front of different people.  How their attitude – how their attitude – their status – their as we call the social class, how the social class develops with the help of this economy?  This – this makes our – this also benefits our country as well.  If we are self dependent with no burden on our governments it will also make our country dependent.  So, I think there are all the, uh – after watching all the pros and cons...
Well, a part-time job is for students is better because they can earn money as well the experience and they can, uh, see the difficulties, uh, which they have to face in the future.  So, if a student has a good grades and is, uh, responsible then the part-time job is good.  But, uh, the student who is careless and has no desire to do well in the school will use a part-time job as an – a lame – lame excuse, so it's all about the time management.  And, it really depends upon the students.  It teach them responsibility.  I am not saying that you have to do work for, um, uh, the 40 hours a week in a factory but spending less than 20 hours or 20 hours after schooling on a weekend would make them realize the importance of things.  That, uh, money doesn't grow on trees and – and how it's hard to buy things you want on a budget.  And, it also teach you the critical thinking, uh, critical skills, values, uh, still I think at this time in life your profession is a student and that learning should come first and the job is second.  Uh, part-time job...
Uh, college life is – is an academic life and, uh, it is best for the student who prepare, uh – who prepare themselves for the education.  But, if someone have, uh, poor financial career then it is – then it is obvious for, uh – then it is, uh – then, uh – they must – then these students must be – must also do, uh, part-time job because it is – because it is helpful for, uh – in their financial career and they must, uh – and they must do their – and, uh – and they do must their study well.  So, it is – so it is – it is best for the, uh – for – for the students who prepare, uh – for the students who can – who cannot – who cannot afford their fees and who cannot afford their educational – educational requirement.
Most of the students cannot afford their, uh, expenses of their education so they have to, uh, do, uh – the part-time job the – that they are doing the education or, uh, in the better job.  Uh, the students firstly do their, uh – complete their education and then doing good job it's much more difficult task for them because, they have to support their family.  They – they are the, uh, um, uh, uh, larger number of the family members and the less members of – the earning person of a single man so they – the part-time job can lessen their burden of their parents and, uh, others educate, uh – and, uh – uh, the part-time job is far more important part of, uh – uh – part of confidence of the students, uh, because they are for the practical field also.  Uh, students who belongs to the poor family part-time job is for – much more important.  They lessen their, uh, burden from, uh – from their parents.
Part-time job is good for students because it gives them money to fulfill their academic desires.  Uh.  It have some disadvantage – uh – disadvantages but, uh, uh, advantages are also there.  Uh, if the, uh, it is said that, uh – the studies lost due to part-time job but it is not, uh, in every case.  I am doing a – uh – I am, uh, doing part-time job but I am also completing my study.  Uh.  It's nothing done – it give us, uh, money to fulfill our academic needs.  Uh, it give, uh, uh, us the experience how to treat with the people.  It give us how to stay in the society.  It, uh, make us a man, a man of words that, uh, we can, uh, we know how to deal with the peoples.  Part-time job is good for, uh, study because it's, uh – some students who can't – can't afford their economic needs they have to do something to complete their academic needs.  That's why part-time job is good for study, uh, as well as for the person to become a good man in the society.  It also gives, uh, experience...
According to me I can strongly agree with that that part-time job of – for college life is good for a man who belong to a poor, uh – who belong to a middle class family because in that family you have a lot – uh, you have a lot of difficulties in, uh, achieving your education.  Your father shouldn't have much money to – to pay your college fee or your brother.  So, you have a lot of chance if you can do that you – you should have a lot of chance to do that.  Otherwise, uh, I did not think that it is necessary for that.  Uh.  You should also gain experience in this, uh, that's good for you and you can do a lot of during this after that.  I can come to state on that that, uh, a part-time job – job is good for you.  You can, uh, get a lot of experience from part-time job.  Part-time job is good for you and, uh...
Part-time job is not possible for the students because, uh, it will burden you a lot and you will not pay attention to where you work.  As I mentioned earlier, that it is not possible for, uh, a student to do – learn and do work.  At the same time as a student you will get lectures and you at the same time if you are doing a job and you have to prepare for some other person, so, uh, the burden of work increased and you feel a lot of tension to work this.  So, it will discourage you after, uh, this thing bring failures in life also.  That when you do not pay heed properly to a certain thing and you will suffer a lot for it.  And, it's, uh, up – it's up to a person whether what temperament he is having.  If it is possible for him to handle both the things at the same time so he may, uh – so he may do that.  And...
Um, I think, uh, a person becomes social, active.  He learns very well.  He learns how to deal with people.  He meet – meets with the people with the – around the world and in our daily routine.  Part-time job is, uh – I – I think part-time job is usual for the students who are in college should not have enough time to do this.  You cannot do study.  Actually, you cannot do study and part-time job at the same time.  You cannot concentrate on your study perfectly.  You see the benefit of part-time.  And there is a benefit of part-time job as such.  He can support all the family if, uh – if he – if they – if he has some problem – financial problems as well that maybe can he support our family – our, uh, other, uh, brothers, sister...
Part time job needs a lot of time and a lot of commitment.  It all depends on the students and on the families whether we are pressurizing the students to do part time job because of the family's low paid, specifically [***] they would pressurize the students, pressurize their son or the daughter to involve in part time job but we all know that college study is not an easygoing task.  For the accomplishment of good grades, students have to work hard.  They have to pay attention to their studies, concentrate on their studies.  Workplaces also demand a lot of attention on the part of the employees, so being a student, it is very difficult to pay full attention to the study and to the job then as a result, he suffers at both places.  He is simply suffering from a certain kind of ment...
Yeah, uh, actually, um, uh, students are mostly because, uh, uh, uh, our areas, uh, are poor, uh, so big, uh – they have to do their job, uh, but I think that they should not do so.  I mean they must have scholarship and government must, uh, support them if they cannot, uh, uh, uh, by doing a part-time job is very, uh – is very, uh, unhealthful for, uh – for their body – for their mind and it's like it can also, uh – it can also affect their study and, uh, they can't get high marks, uh, even in the exam.  And, if they don't get – how they can get job they can't come on merit.  And, uh, they can't be a good student, they will not be good officers, they are not studying according to their, uh, exam, according to their, you know, uh, major subjects according to their abilities.
Part time job is just source to continue studies for those students who are needy and they can't continue the studies without supporting themselves with their own struggle because some parents are financially bad – in bad condition and they can't continue their – their own study that's why for students they should – must have some kind of a part time job so they can support themselves with their – their own struggle and thus they won't need to borrow with money for feeses from someone and it's – it's a kind of dignity which will arose in those students and their – their time will be consumed in the best that way and they don't have to indulge in bad activities, useless, like some students may indulge in...
So the topic of – is about part time job and I think I am not in complete favor of it nor against this part time job because it is the need of the present age.  As there is unemployment in our country and people need job opportunities but they have – although they have a high – highest degree, they studied from very, very high universities and got their degrees but they don't get job in this country and so part time job is such activity that they have to fulfill their expenses or to release the tension of their parents because parents can't afford the student's expenses because the education is much more expense from parents so the student takes step towards this activity either to release their...
I'm disagree with the point that college students should have take part in the job because I think that it may affect grades and their performance negatively and they – students may have – it may affect their abilities to concentrate on their homework and sometimes they don't have enough time to sleep and remain tired and fatigued, and fatigue may affect their educational performance, exam performance and their grades; and working in the irregular hours may also destroy the student's good study habits that I think that they should develop and it may discourage the students from attending the classes regularly and make them eventually dropout, so I'm completely, completely disagree with this statement and the college students should have to pay for – they should have concentrate on their studies only.  They shouldn't do part time job at least for that...
It is very tough for a student get time his job with his study because in this age, students are una – unable to fulfill their basic needs and they – their family cannot support them with their studies and therefore mostly students fulfill their study expenditure or achieve their goals in study – academic activities.  They – they are – they are forces from – from the environment, then they – they do part time – part time job.  In day – in daytime, they study in colleges, universities and as well as other institutions, academic but in a...
I think those students health is more necessity as compared to the studies because the – the health of students can accommodate.  They become [***] if the student – is mentally – is mentally prepared for studies then he can concentrate on his studies, but if he – he was not physically or mentally prepared or healthy, he can't understand even a single thing from the teachers or the students or the lecture which is delivered by his teachers, so I can't agree with you because these are – I think so these are the big reasons of failure in the colleges mostly in Pakistan.  I think so the students should concentrate on their studies first then...
Some [***] students are just after study, the – the search [***] students who they – who they work – how they work and study.  The effect of study is more – is more likely because the heavy burden of their study, the school work – the school work so – so job can be – so job can be affected by the school working [***] the basic.  The [***] maybe understand however between the perception of working for an outcome [***] way.  This customer data from – other statement is just for a while on most no guidance to the result that might be [***] such analysis.  This and as well as [***] student, parents would [***] some reason then other statement is search for a while are most no...
Yes, definitely students should have a part time job these days because – because it will increase their motivation level and it will increase – create a sense of satisfaction and sense of self-respecting them.  Students will be more courageous as they will be less dependent on their parents and then they will feel that they are no more dependent on their parents and definitely they will improve their future goals as well.  They will be having a powerful decision making which will improve their future aims and they will be more successful in their education and in the other field.  When they are doing something on their own behalf, then it will increase – create an attitude and personality and character which will be self-sufficient and will not be anymore dependent to the any other fellow.  That's when they also...
Yes, I am agree to do the job – to do the job – part time job during the studies.  It will really help us, not only help us, it also help us – help our country, our society.  It will create a very good situation and students will know that they have to manage themselves by their own, not to depend anyone else.  It will really create – it will really create us a good atmosphere, a good thing and provide us all the things near us, and when we have the experience of part time job, after that completing the studies we can take – we can got a good job and we can note – we can write this part time job as experience in our CV and it will provide us a good criteria for our job in the future, and in the present, this part time job will really grow – fulfill...
Students have – wants to – all the students have jobs to earn money so they can help their parents and the – in addition to the students, everyone can – everyone who is participating, who is out there to earn money and they cannot support their parents, they cannot support their family with the single part time – with the single job, they try to – they try to do a lot of extra work so they can earn good amount of money to support themselves and – along with their regular jobs, because today – nowadays there is very difficulty for us common man to live in the society to – because they have many troubles, making their bills and if single person is not there to earn because time is...
I think it is good to have a part time job because there are many day-to-day expenses which students – normally students can't afford or for that you have to ask – take money from his parents or guardians, for examples, there are many day-to-day expenses like breakfast or giving a treat to your friends for which you have to take money from – from the parents or guardians, but if you are doing a part time job, it's very less – lessen their burden of expenses your parents bear.  It will be a great help for your parents too and you could also enjoy a sufficient amount of money and you can also enjoy a good amount of money and bear your day-to-day expenses.  You can – even, for example, along with buying...
Part time job – job is very interesting for students.  Some students do part time job – job for – student will doing job – student doing job, it's [***] for experience.  They can do job for their – for their own expenses for their education and it helps for their parents.  If student do job carefully and interestingly, it's a big beneficial for student and for country and for their parents.  The poor [***] country become rich and the poor students get education on their own...
Hi there!  This is XXX.  I am also a student and I am in somewhat favor of students’ part-time job.  Some students have to do part-time jobs due to their financial conditions, but it also affects their study and also their health.  These students cannot study properly and their attention is diverted to their jobs.  They do not have enough time for study and also for rest.  These students are financially weak and they have to support their families.  In this way, their health and study is poorly affected.  Student life is best for every person and everyone wants to be enjoy their student life, but these students sacrifice their own happiness.  I salute to these students who manages everything properly.    
The other benefit of getting a part-time job is that students will realize how to use their money.  Many students still sp  their money on unnecessary things because they do not – they do not know the correct thought about using money.  After they start their part-time jobs, they will know that earning money is not easy as they thought before and they will allocate - allocate their income correctly because it's difficult to earn money so that they will not waste it easily.  Factories and warehouses also take on many students, although the work can be very hard.  Again, competition means that you should organize such work quickly, apparently before the holidays…    
The various costs associated with higher education slowly rising, working part-time while studying is a necessity for many students, what it cover living and academic expenses or to just for the sake of getting hold of a bit of sp ing money, but money is not the only thing.  You can gain from part-time work.  It's a great way to get hands-on feel for the real working world and what it's like to work with other peoples as opposed to the often solitary pursuit involved in studying.  You may even be able to get some experience in the field into which you wish to go demonstrating you patient and getting an invaluable head start.  And they can be particularly useful for international students.    
Actually if you ask me to agree or disagree, I would say that college students should do some job with the studies nowadays.  Everything is too costly all around.  The expenses of colleges have increased and it becomes difficult to live without earning of this kind.  So, if a student learns and earns one at the same time, he is doing justice and is doing excellent.  He is supporting his family members.  By sharing their burden, he can support his family members also.  This is an important support from him.  If his studies are not disturbed at all, it should be continued without any problem, nothing awkward.  Actually, if you ask me to agree or disagree, I would say that college students should do some job within - with the studies nowadays.    
I am totally agreed with this statement that students must have part-time jobs because it’s the only this option by which they can help their parents financially.  Working during studies can be character-building experience for them because it teach them how – how to have their responsibility, commitment, how to show their indep ence.  These grades are valuable in many areas of life and can even help students who are applying for higher education.  To successfully hold on a job while in – studies, students must have time management skills and organization.  Working allows them to practice their skills how to work as a team, how to communicate with others, how to have interview qualities, how to manage their working abilities, how to show them to all.  It can also help them in achieving their academic rewards.  It can help them in social consequence.    
Yes, it is important for college students to have a part-time job because today the cost of life has gone very high as far as day-to-day usings and expenses are concerned.  Mostly, students belong to middle class or lower middle and poor families, and their families are unable to – to support them.  Then - so to lessen the burden on the families and to become self-dep ent, it is essential to have a part-time job, but one thing must be kept in mind that first thing is the study and then comes the job, so time management should be entertained.  Studies and jobs are focused in such a way that neither of the two should be affected by one another.  And all this is possible when the student get determined that he will keep pace with both the jobs.  He must also try to support his family if possible.  Otherwise, just becomes self-dep ent and family indep ent.    
It is not important for college students to have part-time jobs because they cannot manage both college and job.  They cannot give proper time to their studies.  If they started to have part-time jobs, they cannot get good grades.  Their studies will be affected from their job.  If first time they go for studies and second time they go for job, their health will be down.  As we know a healthy body has a healthy mind, so that they cannot concentrate on their studies.  So students should avoid part-time jobs.  First, they should complete their studies, then think about job.  If they study, they have part-time jobs, it's also not good for their future because they have not proper time for studies with job.  So, they should avoid the jobs and complete their studies.  It's better for them.    
I think it is not justice to do some job with the – the studies, but now we see there is inflation all around and the expenses of colleges have gone sky high.  It becomes difficult to meet body and soul together we can say for studies.  So if a student learn and earn, one at same time, he is facing great difficulty but even then, he is doing very good.  He is sharing the burden of his family.  He can support his family members also.  This is an important economic support from him if his studies are not disturbed at all, but he should spare some time for his studies also.  I think it is not justice to do some job with studies, but now we see there is inflation of all around and the expenses of colleges have gone sky high.  It becomes difficult to meet body and soul together we have say for studies, so if…    
I think that it- it's very difficult for students to get job at the time when they are studying as well as working.  They cannot pay attention to their studies well so that some students might interested in part-time jobs, but they cannot get in - but they cannot get job in this.  I think that it is very difficult for students because in this way, two - two sides of the students are affected if they part – if they get job.  Firstly – firstly they cannot improve yourself and secondly it is very hard and it affected their - it affected their healthy - it also affect their health.
