In the side of economic, smoking will decrease the smoker money and in the side of healthy, it will be – it will make the smoker – a – weak and – um – uh – weak - a – smoking is – smoking always – um – smoking always – smoking always – some people say that with smoking they can have new imagination of...


I think smoking should be banned and the government should have the – have the strong agreement to ban the smoking because smoking can kill the on – the smokers and especially the people around the smokers.  Even though government have –even though the – the government can get the high income from the production of smoke or from tobacco, that it is very wrong if the government allow the people or the society to continue smoking.  I think smoking should be banned because – because the people can be killed if they continue the smoking.


Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned, especially in the restaurant where people are eating and then some people are smoking.  It's very dangerous and [***].  Smell of the food will be not good and also it is very dangerous for people around them.  Smoke and the compound of cigarettes are very dangerous, especially for the children when they – a – yeah when they are [***] smoker and definitely not only the smoker, will have [***] but also the environment and the people around them especially [***] how come we're eating [***] suddenly the smoke are coming from – from the smoker that are not – that – a...


Smoking at a restaurant is very, very bad for person who do it because in a restaurant, we are – it's a place we are – if we're eating something and at the same time, there is smokers around us, it will – a – very – what is – very, very – um – if – a – they will bother us when we are eating and also at same time they give us – a – very dangerous disease and I – I don't agree with the smokers.  Every – every smoker – a – not only at the restaurant, but all of smokers should be placed in a one place if they are still want to be smokers.


I agree with the smoking banning to applied in every country in the world, because smoking has dangerous – dangerous impact for health – on health and I think that the government should have the [***] to the people if they're consuming cigarette.  They should have - give the fine for the smoker that catch up in such - smoking in the public place and then decreasing the cigarette itself on - [***] something like in the market.


I agree that smoking should be banned because some medical studies have shown that some smoke – that smoking not only injurious to health problems for the smoker, but also for people close by.  [***].  Many believe that smoking should not be around, for example in public places.  Smoking can cause serious health problem to the smoker themselves and to those in having second-hand smoke.  Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substance - substance including a lot of carcinogen and nicotine, which is addictive.  Smoking can cause cancer, emphysema, and heart disease.  It can also shorten your life by up to 10 years or more.  In having second-hand smoke from different sources can be [***] the cigarette smoke for as little as 13 units a day...


I agree when smoking is banned because smoking will create a lot of dangerous thing and hazardous disease for human – a – because I think the one who is smoking is very disturbing people – a – and it can cause – and it can damage another – another one.  About I – I am a person from the city that produce cigarette, but I really agree when smoking is banned and it's prohibited in our country.


If – if cigarette is completely banned – a – then there – there will be a lot of unemployment, especially in Indonesia and there would be poverty – poverty – more poverty in Indonesia and there – there're a lot of people who – who lo – lose their job because of the – because of their company is banned and also people who – who have addiction to – to the – to the cigarette, they – they cannot stop, so they will – they will look for illegal cigarettes and – and it is only increase the criminal – criminals in this world, so for the – for the – a – people who have an addiction to cigarettes, they should take care of – of theirself because it is impossible to completely ban cigarette...


I agree with that a – smoking should be banned at the country because smoking is dangerous for our body because in the – in the cigarette, there is – a – dangerous substances such as carbon dioxide, tar, nicotine that dangerous for our health.  It can cause death.  Also it can cause many diseases such as cancer, health problems, psychological health problems.  And the smoking is not also dangerous for us but for others- the other people because a passive smoker is more dangerous rather than the active smokers because in passive smokers, we know that – a – the passive smokers spread more people rather than the active smokers, so the smoke is more evenly enter the body and it can cause – a – several problems in the passive smoker's body rather than the active smoker.


I agree that smoking should be completely banned because of some reasons.  First, smoking is harmful both for the passive smokers and the active smokers themselves.  Smoking can cause some diseases such as lung cancer, breast cancer, impotence, heart disease, miscarriage for pregnant women, and many more, because the cigarette itself contains dangerous substances such as nicotine, carbon monoxide, ammonium, and so on.  It is even more harmful for the passive smoker.

Second, smokers spend much money to buy the cigarette.  It is better to spend money for something which has a good benefit than to buy something which cle – clearly can be harmful for our health like cigarette.  We can spend our money to buy vegetable, to do sport or to buy something else which is good for our health, so we shouldn't buy cigarette and we should stop smoke...


...in restaurant [***] build up the cigarettes.  The smell and waste of cigarette is very, very annoying especially for people who doesn't not smoking and cigarettes [***] and it's sort of built after [***] or the – felt like discomfort especially in restaurant, restaurant will have - we have – we – in restaurant, we – we're going to eat, not to filling of our lung with a full of cigarette and I think it's really annoying if smoker should be allowed in restaurant.  And as my experience that in restaurant, I have eaten in one restaurant, in my - near me if there're smokers, then like I have to think to – I tried to talk...


Oh – oh – I will continue with my – my opinion about the smoking because, yeah I – I – what I said before is [***] because cigarette will – will make you deficient or make you bankrupt because what will you do for living with your family and your children with a pack of cigarettes.  And it will cost so much like 300 rupiah for you – you buy it three ta – three times a day, not only for a day, but every day and obviously smoking is 100% can cause death and other disease.  Well, like in restaurant...


Uh – I agree with that statement, um – it's – a – although smoke and cigarette factory is – can give lot of benefits for this country, but I think – a – it's not give any benefit for – for people, for acquaintances and especially for – for the health of active smoker or may be the passive, so it's not bring any benefits at all.  A – that's my – a – that's my argument about smoking.  So I agree it's banned of this country and another...


...we said that dangerous ingredients, smoking can cause so many dangerous disease such as pulmonic cancer, breast cancer, and then heart attack and then impotence, so every smoking in the restaurant, we will danger ourself and the others, because the effect of smoking is not only for the smoker, it also – it also give bad effect for the passive smokers.  And passive smokers will get the – will get more danger – more dangerous effects from smoking.  So, I think that smoking in restaurant as the public place is not allowed.  I'm agree with this topic.


I agree that smoke must be prohibited because I think – a – the cigarette is contains the really dangerous – dangerous substance and that is so dangerous for health too and some – and if the – if the active smoker consume so many kinds of dangerous substance as I said before like nicotine or something like that, if they consume very long time, the smoker can have lung cancer, can get the asthma or cough and – and that will be dangerous, they can premature death.  On the other hand, that I really don't as a passive smoker, I really feel irritating with that.


For my country I agree because smoking is one habit that I certainly see of human habitual for this moment.  So, I thought smoking has been clearly proof that cigarette has a negative impact to human life who smoke and those who didn't smoke.  And on the packs of this cigarette, there also clarified that cigarette cause any deadly disease and in cigarette there has many bad con – content [***].  However, the fact that many people still smoke in...


I agree because – because the smoke has the special place to smoker and not – not – not only to – to – it's only – it's only in a public areas or more special or more special place to smoke.  And he – and to consider risk when he is – about the smoke in another area in a special place, like in public area or in another place is very [***].  I think that – that government has to reserve a place in another – in another public area...


I definitely agree because of what smoking is the most dangerous thing for the life, for the health, for the environment, because it is not only affect for the smoker but for the others too.  I think that environment around of the smoker.  I never agree for this because I want to make and have a better life in my future, especially for this world, this environment.  We should think about it.  Smoking is a dangerous thing too for our home.  Everything will be bad if we smoke like my father.  My father is the bad smoker actually because he smokes two packs in a day.  Yes.  I think it's bad, but we care about home so that I want to - smoking is to be banned Indonesia.  No one can smoke in Indonesia.  Just every – everyone can smoke in Indonesia, everything, environment will be better and then we have a better future, environment life better, everything will be better actually.


I think smoking should be banned.  It's because it can disturbing other peoples like old man or old womans, kids or pregnant woman, because the smoke can make them cannot breathe well.  My hope is government should make a regulation that smokers should less smoking, because it can make the air pollute and make other peoples around them feel not comfortable.  Because of the smoke also for younger people or senior high school students should not allowed to smoking, because it can make them become bad.  So that's why young people should not smoking.  I have experience about my friends who are smoking and now he is – he is starting again and he didn't have exam.  I feel pity to him because he cannot...


Smoking in public areas is not polite.  You know, your cigarette could make negative effect for the others around you.  It's not polite to become smoking in a public place.  Smoking, you know, it could make many kind of disease or illness like cancer and many others could not make a negative effect from smoking.  It's not polite.  You still enjoy your smoking, but the other – it's disturbing the others.  They could have negative – negative effect for the others.


I think smoking is unhealthy for our body.  Smoking can bring bad effect; for example, cancer, impotence, and etcetera.  And smoking can make bad for ourself and others.  So, yes, I agree with the statement that smoking must be banned, what, in our country.  Smoking increase the risk of pollution, global warming and diseases in people.  And smoking should be banned because when people throw the cigarette...


In my country, we have rule about smoking.  And I think many people smoke, but in our country have a lot of – of smoking.  And then I – I – I can – I – I cannot – I don't like if the man smoke.  I don't like smoking people because it can get really...


Smoking should be banned in public place, I am agreeing.  Smoking increase the risk of pollution, global warming, and diseases in people.  People who smoke are more likely to develop disease such as lung cancer and liver cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis is mostly caused by smoking and reduces and even poisons the liver, unable for the organ to perform its – its function.  For example, a healthy lung in – changes in colors and have the person breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, but a smoker's lung is very dark, it's covered with tar, tar.  A smoker's lung is unable to functional – functionally help the person breathe and increase risk for asthma, it cause stroke and heart attack.


Disagree.  Completely banned in the country, have you lost your mind?  In my country, Indonesia, cigarette, it give a lot of tax for the government.  Come on, you want to the government broke up.  And what happen tomorrow in my country will be poor and all.  We just we can't do that.  We cannot do that.  What do you – what – what do you worry about, smoke kill?  Yeah, but in some case people should be know how to protect that.  I mean, how to – how to – yeah, it's the fact that for...


Yeah.  I agree with personally because I am a smoker.  Because when you are want to smoke, you should smoke in smoking area and you didn't interrupt other people besides you.  Because smoke have – make you [***].  Because smoke can make a cancer and hurt your lungs.

[****]
Yeah, it can interrupt other people besides you, because smoke is...


I disagree if smoking.  I think that smoking is very danger for our healthy.  It can affect life.  It just seems reality.  It's so danger for our healthy.  Do you know actually passive smokers are more dangerous than active smokers, why?  And clearly an Indonesian smoker, he usually – anyway, the smoker usually smoke everywhere they want.  They didn't – they don't caring that if you are feel - I hate, but – I hate, but when they smoke out here, they smoke everywhere they want.  They don't see anything that if you are feel - and until now, there is no strong regulation for our government.  The Indonesian government have...


Okay.  I'm agree with statement prohibition of the smoking in restaurant or public place, because if not prohibition on the smoking in public place can make environment not healthy and disturb other people with smoke generate otherwise smoking room in their restaurant.  The government should be able to make prohibition of the smoking in public place become strong and so the government should be able to make smoking room in public place everywhere.


I think that smoking should be banned from every public place.  I agree about that because smokers really disturbing people who don't smoke.  When they at the public place, they always smoke and disturbing.  Their smoke disturb others people, so they make some hard to breathing.  So, they also coughing because of the smoke.  That's why smoking should be banned because it's really, really disturbing.  And even they are – they throw their smokes and they use almost every day that make them very smelly.  That's why smoke should be banned from the public place and they again use it at private place or maybe the place that already deserves to smoking area, like smoking area or smoking places.


I obviously agree that smoking are banned in the restaurant.  I mean it's not also – it's not just in restaurant, also in many public area, because some – I think that some – many people smoking they [***] spend their money wasting their time by – by sitting and – and doing something not good.  They – they like burn their money and it's harm for our – for – it's harm the body and not good for health.  Also for the people around – around them who're not smoking directly, but they also sniff the – the smoke.  And it's very, very danger for every people.


I am not completely agree with the – with the talk of that everyone who love smoking should be banned in all the restaurant.  Yes, but sometimes people who really love to smoke cannot hold their – their feeling of need to smoke.  So, I just – that would be really – I will [***] them if they can't smoke.  But still if they smoke in the restaurant or public places, it would be really disturbing the others and could harm the others.  While smoking is really bad for the health and if there's let's say a pregnant woman in there, it could harm the mother and the baby.


Okay.  So, I will tell you about my opinion.  And my opinion about do you agree or not if smoking in the public place, I think my opinion is I disagree, because it may disturb my friend or people in the public place.  And if I smoking in the public place, I not – not good, not good for my health and it may make cancer in the future.  And if we smoking in the public place, we not – not see about the people have...


Okay.  I will tell you very briefly with smoking the [***] makes my heart instead [***] passive worse than [***] because smoking [***] should be banned [***] decrease my money and [***] and smoke not very useful for me, because smoking...


Yes.  I agree with the statement, because smoking can make people smell.  I guess, first of all, make or like make your breath of your – of your – of your coughing [***].  The health is very [***] careful – carefully and then to make the [***] of the people in there, because smoke cannot...


I really not like and disagree to people who smoke, especially those who smoke in public place.  Because in addition to harming his or her life, that can harm others and I think that still agrees.  And the effect of cigarette is more dangerous for passive smokers than active smokers.  The example, effect of smoke like cancer and impotence maybe as well.  I disagree about smoke, because it can make it – it's a source to waste her or his money.  On average, it costs them 300,000 to 500,000 rupiah per month just to buy cigarette.  And just with the...


Okay.  I agree with the statement that says that people should ban smoking in the country, because I have seen although smoking can make increasing the investment in the country, but the negative effect is more powerful than the positive effect.  The first one is it will increase the death of people in the country, because you know that smoking can have highest in human health; for example, cancer, lung cancer...


I totally agree with the banned for the smoking in – for smoking in the country, because there are so many disadvantages of one thing the disadvantage of smoke.  The first one is it start wasting your money.  The money is for – they – they use for purchasing cigarette, they can use it for the other things.  And then the second one is about when someone smokes in the public area, of course it will disturb the public companion.  It is related with someone who has – who is – who has partner [***] or something like that.  And then of course and the import – the most important matter is about have [***].  The [***] is the most urgent thing that is that it can be disturbed if we – if they or someone smokes, not only for the smoker itself but also for the passive smokers.  For the passive smokers...


I agree that smoking should be banned in this world, because we know that in this the smoking is really dangerous, not only to the passive smoker or the – not only to the active smoker also passive one.  The more dangerous is for the passive one, because the effect – the bad effect for the passive one is more dangerous.  And the bad effect for smoking can affect the liver, the – the some part of bodies that – that are really, really important to have.  So in order to make the world healthier and clean – clearer, smoking should be banned for this world.  And also nowadays the – the...


Smoking are totally bad habit, as there is no advantage of this kind of habit, because smoking will make the smoker become weak and sick.  There is no advantages of this kind of habit.  Also, in every sing – in every single point – in every point of view, there is no one thing that make this habit is – should be – should be done.


I agree if the smoking is being banned, because smoking can kill the smokers and people around them.  Ironically, the passive smoker or the people who inhales the – the smoke they will be – they will have a more – they – they will have more effect on the smoke.  Even though smoking – even though the tobacco has very high income, I think it – it kills the smoker.  We – the government should ban smoking, because their people, their society can be – can be killed by the smoking.  And I think for the government they can...


Smoker.  Yeah, I agree that smoking should be banned completely for my country, because the – the smoker it give very disadvantage not only for themselves but also for the environment.  But how come they smoke, it means that they burn then harm their lungs and as we know it maybe they as soon as possible before the time that it is – yeah, I agree that smoking should be banned in my country and also support like people around me, especially with children, and yeah it's very, very dangerous.  That's why I agree that smoking should be banned, because it give disadvantage not only for the smokers but also for the people around the smokers and environment.


You are asking me about smoking people in this days are, of course, I don't agree with those who are smoking because, yeah, apart from economic – economic condition of our nation or others, we – we have to look at when person healthy.  I mean we – we – we just – we are just human beings and we know that every part of cigarette is a very, very dangerous for our healthy, for our body, and it will damage all of our body inside or outside.  And not only for the smokers itself for the passive smokers, it will create a terrible situation for them.  So...


Yeah, the – the smoking banning in the every countries I think is – will be the effective – effective effort to decrease amount of the smoking rate in – in the – in every people in the work.  I think the government have – have to – have – has to make a strong policy to decreasing and reducing the use of cigarette by decreasing amount of the cigarette on the supermarket also some – something like that.  And they should do the...


I believe that smoking it should be banned in public places.  So, this has found that smoking not only do health problem for the smoker but also for people close by.  As far as sort of this, many believe that smoking should not be allowed in public pla – places.  Although there are agreement on both sides, I strongly believe that ban is the most appropriate course of action.  Smoking in public places should be banned for two reasons: it can be hard, especially those – to people health, and it is very unpleasant to watch someone smoking.  Smoking can cause serious health problem to the smoker themselves and to those inhaling secondhand smoke.  Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substance, including a lot of carcinogen, and nicotine which is addictive.  Smoking can cause cancer, as we said...


I agree, because smoking is a bad habit for me.  I really don't like the one who is smoking, because it can cause a lot of dangerous thing, such as cancer and then – and another hazardous – and another hazardous disease.  Although I am – I am a person from the city that – that produce cigarette, but of course I really dislike the one who are smoking.


I – I disagree if – if cigarette it should be banned completely, because cigarette is like a culture for – for not in Indonesia, but also in worldwide.  Everyone – not everyone, most – well, a lot of people like to smoke and if a – if smoking is completely banned, they will – they will look for another – another way to – to – to looking for – to look for a cigarette.  They – they also would like to give a lot of money to give – to get the cigarette they – they want to get.  Also, there are – there are a lot of cigarette company in Indonesia.  I think that completely ban the cigarette company is – is not wise, because there would be a lot of unemp...


It as in – in the cigarettes contains – contains dangerous substances or such as nicotine, tar, carbon dioxide, and so on, that it makes those of – those diseases.  I mean like a cancer.  It – smoking is not – is – is – there is no any benefit from smoking, because it only cause attack.  And – and smoking is not only dangerous for us but for other people, because a passive smokers is more dangerous rather than active smokers.  Because in the passive smokers we – we spread the smoke more deeply rather than the active smokers and it makes the diseases...


I agree that smoking should be completely banned, because of some reasons.  First, smoking is harmful, both for the passive smokers and the active smokers themselves.  Smoking can – smoking can cause some diseases, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, impotence, heart disease, miscarriage for pregnant women and many more, because the cigarette itself contains dangerous substances, such as nicotine, carbon monoxide, ammonium and so on.  It is even more harmful for the passive smoker.  Second, smoker spend much money to buy the cigarette.  It's better to spend money for something which has a good benefit than to buy something which clearly can be harmful for our health, like cigarette.  We can spend our money to buy vegetable, to do sports or to buy something as which is good for our health.  I think buying cigarette has no good benefit.


I agree that smoke should be banned in; at first, it will damage their lungs, because in cigarette there are a lot of lie chemistry that make their lungs will be hurt and it creates some fumes [***] that are dangerous.  And secondly, it will dangerous for children, since the smokers will not smoke when they are only, but sometimes smokers will smoke in public place just like bars and shelter bars or another place that with a lot of people, especially – especially children and women or pregnant woman, it – it's really dangerous.  And third, it causes both as the cigarette, since not a lot of in – people – the smokers in one country...


I strongly disagree with the motion that we should ban smoking in public places, like restaurant or public – public places, transportation or something else, because it will some kind of poisoning your food, poisoning your life, and poisoning your – your lungs also, because cigarette has so many poisoning substances.  This is not to be consumed, but people who only considering money, but smokers company and for doing this anything, since it is for this cigarette which has and addicted that.  So, the smokers will be addicted with this cigarette.  And second, of course it will change your purse, because one pack of cigarette is about 300 rupiahs...


I agree with that statement, because smoking is not only danger for the active smoker but also the passive – the – the passive I mean people who – the passive smoking is not good for our lungs and our health.  It's not only danger for the active smoker it's al – but also for the passive plus as well as children, mother, and...


I agree with this topic, because smoking are very dangerous for the smoker and the passive smoker.  Smoking is very dangerous, because there are – there are all the ingredients are dangerous.  The first is nicotine; nicotine is a substance that can make people addicted and also will broken the – will broke the – will broke the tissues on the brain.  Nicotine also cause blood poison and also – and also – and then the ingredient is just tar; tar is the basis – basic...


I agree that smoke must be prohibited, because personally I don't like the – the cigarette or the people who smoke – who smoking, because I – I think the content of cigarette is really dangerous for health, because it contains some of the dangerous substance and that is so very, very dangerous for our body.  Especially for active smoker, the active smoker – if passive smoker consumes so many kinds of it's like dangerous – dangerous substance, as I said before, they – and if they consume for a long time, they can lead to premature death, lung cancer...


...however in the fact that many people still smoke and the smoke itself has a function to reduce stress for the user, but smoking will also causes the stress on the people around them, so I think maybe it's a – that habitual that make theirself has a disease and make people in around them get the disease too, so smoking is the – that habitual in human – for human and for – and – and for environment because...


I disagree because [***] about the smoking that it's the [***] actually the government still make the special place in another – in other – and other place in public areas besides the special or another special [***] it is special place to smoke – to smoke for the smoker and then the public area is not the – [***] is not the statement about the smoke – then the smoker will smoke but this statement is not...


Yes, I'm definitely agree because it is not only affect to the smoker but for the others too, for the environment too, for around the smoker too.  I never agree for this because my father is a bad smoker, so that I want to – the smoking is – has to be banned in Indonesia, especially in Indonesia because what – when we – when smoke – smoking has been banned in Indonesia, everyone cannot speak – cannot smoke.  I think environment will be better, environment will be – will be better.  We have – a – will be better – better environment, better future, better life actually because Indonesia has a lot of companies that produce cigarettes.  It's very, very bad.  I want to the – I want to ban this.  I want to make this rule.  I want to – a – try this.  I want to – yes – leave it.  Indonesia has to be better before it will be banned, something like...


I'm very agree if smoking will be banned because it can disturbing other people like all peoples, kids, or pregnant women.  It – it can make the – cannot work – make them cannot tolerate.  My hope is government should make a regulation that smoker should left smoking because it make the air pollute and makes people around them feel not comfortable because the smoke and also for younger people also not allowed the smoking because it make – it can make them becomes bad, so that's why youngs people should not smoking.  And if smoker want to smoke, I think the government should make a room for – to smoke because some of the smoker is smoking in public place, not in...


Smoking in a public areas is not right.  You know smoking could make many kind of negative effects such as like cancer, heart attack, and many others and etcetera, you know.  It is not polite to smoking at public area.  When you still enjoying your cigarette, but the others is hurt - by your – a - doing – by what are you doing.  You can also smoke, but do not smoke in a public areas, you can smoke in - on your home in a yard or etcetera, but do not smoke in a public area.  It's...


I think smoking is unhealthy for our body because smoking can bring bad effect, for example cancer, impotent, and etcetera.  For that, I agree with this statement that smoking must be banned in our country.  Smoking can make bad effect for ourself and others.  Smoking increase [***] pollution, global warming, and [***].  Smoking should be banned because when people throw cigarettes on the grounds daily, it might cause a fire.  A...

Yes, I am agree – a – about smoking shall be banned in public place because smoking – it is unhealthy.  First of all, it's really unhealthy.  It's bad for a person and bad for the environment.  It is – it's bad for the environment because the smoke cause in the air – in the air and caused pollution.  It is my – it is a major cause for secondhand smoke, lung cancer and death.  The pollution of some people causing effect on the life of others.  Smoking doesn't good for everyone.


Don't ban it.  I am disagree, absolutely disagree.  Cigarettes in my country give a lot of tax for the government, main - my country - banned in other country.  I can imagine that the government will improve economies, tariffs everywhere, poor people, dried up.  Can you imagine that?  That's worst thing that I have heard.  You know in some case, it's bad idea, bad – bad thing for child and something, but their family should be know - should be just with their kid.


Smoke - I agree with that statement because if you're wanna smoke – smoke in smoking area, so you don't interrupt other people because smoke – it's unhealthy and it's make you hard, you can get cancer and other illness, so – smoke really [***].  It's really risky because you smoke and you smoking, it's wasting your money and your time and you will get sick if you are always smoke, so don't smoke and you will be healthy.  And if you're in a...

Until now, there is no strong regulation from our government - Indonesian government until now [***].  Smoking is dangerous, but [***] smoke everywhere.  You know passive smoker are more dangerous than active smoker, so that's why [***]

I agree about smoking should be banned in the public place because smoke – smoke is very disturbing.  Every smoker who smokes the cigarette is always smoke at a public place that others who don't smoke got disturbed from – from their smoke, that's why they need to be smoke at the private place or smoking area, so the others can do not – not be disturbed, that will make a win-win solution from both.  And smoker should be careful from their cigarette because some of their cigarette can burn someone's hand or hair and they – it's bad for their health.  That's why they need to be more concerned about their health and should be...


Oh – yeah, I – I obviously agree that smoking is banned – smoking is banned – smoking is banned in the restaurant, I mean it's not just in the restaurant, it's also in the many public area like in the mall or many people that gathering – so many people smoking – smoke should be banned because – smoke – smoking just burning your money and it's harm your healthy.  It's not go – good for ma – for – for your body and – and – and it's – it's not good for all the people around the smoker because they sniff the smoke too, so that means it's not good for...


So smoking could harm the others.  I think they should be banned, but not completely – completely banned from all the restaurant.  So the restaurant should build the space between the others who – others who hate smokes and the people who love smoke should be placed in – seated in an exclusive place for the smoking – for smoking people.  Then they could not harm the others.  If they have different space, it work – it work for both of them and it's a win-win solution I think.


Okay – I have tell to you for my opinion to you when smoke – I disagree smoking in the public place.  Uh – okay, my opinion is I – I disagree some people smoking in the public place why because some – because the people can disturb other people in the – around of – of the man, why?  Because smoking can make not good in the health and smoking can make a cancer in the future.  And I – I – I – I think if we're smoking in the public place, we think not good by –by my friend and by other people because...


[***] disagree with smoking [***] environment.  I dislike [***] and it can make – make my [***] smoking is nothing useful for me and every people and smoking is only waste my money, no – nothing useful for me and for other people.


Yes, smoke is not healthy for body because smoke can make body not healthy.  Health is very kindly for your body and health is not – [***] health is very expensive in the [***] for smoke.  Smoke can [***] they're not kindly for this.  Smoke – smoke and – smoke cannot be affordable for health.


I di – disagree to people who smoke especially those who smoke in public – in public place because in addition to harming his or herself can harm others.  And I think that's [***] and the effect of cigarette is more dangerous for passive smokers than active smokers.  [***] effect of the smoke like cancer and the effect of smoke, it can make it difficult to save her or – or his money.  [***] spend 300,000 to 500,000 rupiahs [***] cigarette with the increasing cigarette price.


I think I agree with the statement because in restaurant, it is a public place, so there is – there are a lot of people standing and sitting there.  The most important thing that if you smoke in the public places, you can risk another people in there, for example you can make other people suck your smoke and then it will be very dangerous for our heart, for example it – it can be caused – a – cancer or maybe another diseases caused by the smoke itself.  And I agree that restaurants should ban people who want to smoke in this area.


I totally opposed for people who smoke in the restaurant, because first one is it is disturbed public companion.  Of course, it is disturbed public companion, because not all of people are smoking and some of them are really hate the smoke of the smokers.  And of course, the most – the most important thing is the very smoking is disturbing, it can make theirself or the smokers and the passive smokers, especially for the passive smokers, they can have more risk than the active smokers because they do not have the filter that is contained in the smoke.  And when they – when the smokers do no pay attention for them who are [***] smoke, they can – they – they can really – they can really disturb them...

It's because the bad effects for smoking itself not only is that - for active smoker, but also the passive smoker.  The passive smoke can be – the effect for passive can be more dangerous because the – the smoking itself can – can affect the lung, the liver, or - and etcetera and ban itself make the active smoker more care towards the passive smoker and – and know that the world is more – it's really beneficial to...
