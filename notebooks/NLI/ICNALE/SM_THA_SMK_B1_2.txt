I agree to smoke in restaurant, this will make almost [***] look bad.  The foods were not tasty.  No one want to come into the stall or no [***] eventually complain because [***] smoking in the restaurant, it is also the case of many diseases [***] and destruction of air pollution by breathing.  I don't like [***] into smoking, but if I don't – I'm not going [***] I don't like.  I like to [***].

But I think people who smoke is addicted to it, I suggest them to give – give it up – give up smoking because if not...

I agree with you that the restaurant should ban to smoke in a restaurant, but – however, you should make a smoking area outside the restaurant and there're two group of people, one that a smoker or – and a nonsmoker.  The problem is if people smoke in the area that crowded or there're too many people in the area such as a restaurant or anywhere else, the – the smoke will harm to another person that who don't smoke.  If you not allow them to smoke in a restaurant, then you should prepare the – the area for them that they can smoke freely.  Uhh – I'm a smoker too, so I understand – Haa – I know how it feels that if they want – if a smoker want to smoke and they cannot – it feels as like very terrible for them.  Then...

I don't agree with it.  Restaurant should ban smoke – smoker in – in – in restaurant because smoking is bad for smoker but is this more bad for what else and this is thing that is tough [***] and – and smoking is bad smell I don't like it too.  I believe that one [***] don't like it too because it is bad...
Okay in this topic your  --  you tell me that you ban smoking 100% in my country I think that  --  I think that I disagree with this topic because it is for a long time that people smoking for with you are strict and I think that if you ban 100 smoking in the country the foreigner or the tourist from other country to go in my country.  It will reduce [***] tourism because the foreigner is smoking too and I think that the fact -- 
Yeah I agree with you because I think the restaurant has many people.  As I know students young but working – working people and kids yeah some people don't like smoking and smoking can make your disease – smoking is mental – smoking is cause of cancer in people it – smoking does not have as one health.  It can make your early death more than people non-smoking, but if you want to live long you should [***] behavior therefore I think people don't show some more...
Smoking in the restaurant I think [***] in the restaurant because smoking is bad to our  --  smoking makes [***] and people near smokers such as make [***] make someone else die doesn't [***] health makes lung cancer which is [***].  If you have young smokers whose kids it means more and more [***] besides smoking in the restaurant make the air in the restaurant where many people long time in this restaurant.
Um, well, first I have to say that I don't like the people who smoking, but I am disagree with this topic, because I think that – um – the restaurant should have to – um –have a smoking zone for these people, yes, because I – I think that – uh – if the restaurant has the zone for these people then the restaurant will have visit of – of all kind of people.  If the restaurant bans these people they will – they will have less – more less people to go in the restaurant.
Um, smoke in a restaurant is not good to – um – everybody around you, because – um –it's contained of toxic such as – um – nicotine, carbon dioxide, and – um –other toxic substance that really harmful for – um – smoker and – um – yeah and people around you, and that's a reason of sick – sickness of people in – in – um – today in modern societies and – um –in some countries if they have a like – um –really strict legal.  Uh, so – um – you may caught in jail if you smoke in restaurant, because they – if – if they – if they already warn you that – um – we prohibit...
I agree with the statement, because I think it – this are appropriate to not only smoking in restaurant because – uh – in restaurant if the public have – uh – many audience – uh – both student and adult, smoking can cause a toxic fume, this is a very dangerous to those who inhale.  It will – it will destroy the lungs and other organs and the toxic smoke may contaminate food and cause harm not only at restaurant that do not smoke.  The other is that...
I agree with the statement that in the restaurant they – they should not smoking, but in some of the restaurant they allow the people to smoking in the area that they provide.  In Thailand is that most of the restaurant have banned smoking, but in some restaurant they have a smoking area for people who smoke and not in – not only in the restaurant but in a department store they have the smoking area, and they are not allowed the people to smoking in the department, and in school or un – uni...
Uhh – in this case when you smoking in the restaurant, I think it is bad to yourself and cause – and causes other people inside the restaurant to be a – it cause a very bad smell.  As you know nicotine is in the – in the smoke, in the cigarettes make – make – doesn't – doesn't – doesn't make you the smoker feel – smells bad, but it also – when – when the other people inside the restaurant breathe it in, it – it also the smoke that the second – second people breathe in, it also cause some harmful – harmful diseases and it also bad to their lungs too.  I think they should – they should do ban this – this case of smoking.

Yes, I think it's very, very big – very, very bad for you if you just smoke cigarette because – I – I – I just ask you if you smoke who have a benefit from that.  No, right?  And you want to have it [***] you breathe the smoke from the cigarette.  Yes, that the – that the one [***] will be – will be [***] smoking in the public banned in the [***] because it's not good for anyone and [***] anyone that the [***] smoke who smoke and [***], but okay, I don't think so it is acceptable.

Yes, smoking in the restaurant, you should not smoking if that restaurant is have air conditioner, smoking smell, so everyone have smell your smoke when a smoke smell – when [***], so if you smell – you smoking and everyone can smell – can smell your smoking then so everyone won't happy because if he don't [***] smoking, he will about [***] angry, you are [***] and you will – will change.  Everyone will make – you – you look at you and it's not same [***].  If you're smoking, everyone will get [***] because of your – your smoke.

[***] talk about the smoking in the public, so smoking in the restaurant is one other topic that, so that is not good for smoke on the restaurant, but I think some people they need smoking [***], so I think there must be the place for the smoker or the [***] the back of the restaurant or such a place that [***] for smoker.  That will not [***] anyone or [***] anyone to – a – get the smoke and get it [***].  I think that there're many solution for smoke – smoker [***] it might be the win-win situation for this test [***].

I really agree that people who smoking cannot be smoke at the restaurant or anywhere because I think smoking can disturb the people around you.  And smoking is not good for our health, our body that destroy our system [***] even though system and I think that smoking should be [***] not like – if you smoke, you must have – you must respond your – your behavior...

Okay.  I think smoking in restaurant is need to be banned.  I think it's not the good idea to smoke at all.  I don't know the benefit of the smoking.  I think it's very destroy your health and it's a risk of money.  Smoking a lot can cause you a cancer like – and it also disturb other people that didn't smoke.  The smoke is already a bad smell and the smoke itself is I think irritating.  Other people go to the restaurant to eat, they don't – they wouldn't like to smell other things than food I think in...

I – I disagree with this statement.  There are no research about smoking can decrease the cholesterol.  I think that is fake new.  If you search about smoking, you will find the answer that smoking is making your health – the doctor always tells that the smoking is...

Okay, smoking in restaurant is bad – bad – bad – very bad for – for you and for – for – for many people bec – because when you will eat or you have lunch or have dinner if you smoking in restaurant, I think everyone is – is – is talk to you about your bad behavior.  I – I think you should smoking in a – in smoke area – in everywhere [***] have this area for you if you want to smoking.  Okay in this – in this time, I think if you smoking, you should...

I think I agree with you because smoking is not good for your health and your – people around you.  I think when you want to smoking, you will go to smoke in the area that they prepared to you.  When you smoking in the – not your area, it's not good for people around you because some people is the girl, is a children, is a – is an old – old women or a student or – I think it's not good.  I think people smoking is not very smart – but not smart or not smart – I don't know or know [***].  I think smoking is very bad because my father, he died for smoking.  He died because he smoke more than –more than and more than 10 years ago he smoking.  I...

So the smoking in the restaurant I think is not okay because the people who went to the restaurant, they went for eating.  They enjoy eating, but they don't enjoy smoking because smoking destroy our health.  When you breathe in, the smoking is not the smell of – smoking is not good and the cigarette made of many chemical that destroy our health.  I think they don't happy with the people who come to restaurant and they always – they keep smoking and they keep eating, I think it's not okay.  It's destroy – the atmosphere at a restaurant also destroy the health at the restaurant too, so we have to have – we have to...

I disappear – disagree with this idea that smoking should be banned for this country because – umm – when you grow up, you have more stress and tension that you can release it by smoking.  Yeah – and for [****] – for the way that make it [***], you should [***] set area for smoking, does not look for it, does not [***] other people yeah, you have to [***].  You have...

I disagree of banning smoking because I think a lot of adults, students they have a lot of work.  They must have much more tension and smoking can release their tension may be – I think – I think it can and –but – but for another people here they must prepare a smoking area for – for – for them.  And [****] and teach their student that smoking is bad for their health.

I agree to ban smoking in the public place because it will kill people and children allow you.  Some people will hate you when you are smoking beside them.  Some people die because of the people are smoking beside them.  A lot of people did not smoking, but they can die.  So I [***] is good to stop people who are smoking in the public place.  They are to smoke in the [***] place outside the building.

I'm disagree for smoking.  Smoking is – is a bad thing – is bad for life, my life and your life and everything is kill many people in this day.  I – I have smoking and I – I come to – I come to smoking.  I – smoking is a – umm – smoking is killed – killed my cousin.

The smoking is bad for health.  We know of lung cancer, smoking is a major cause of lung cancer.  In our breath, in addition toxin, in cigarette smoke can cause diseases [***], emphysema and [***] chronic chest [***] cigarette smoke also chest [***] chronic inflammation of the bronchial tube [***].  And now people [***] [***] I don't like.  I want to help people.

I can say the firsthand smoking should be banned.  I agree with it because we like a suggestion [***] because smoking is – is the right for you to do like you drink – you can drink in the bar.  And smoking – you – you can smoke.  But if you smoke in the smoking zone, but you shouldn't smoke when you [***] smoking.  Another kind of men who are addict to smoke – smoking, but I think I know some of them, but this is hard – it hard to give up it.  I – I don't know – I suggest them to give – give up, but they can't.  About smoking, I agree that we shouldn't ban them, but we should smoke whenever – wherever...

Just like I said I agree with you, but the point is if the people smoke in the area that are really crowded, so then a – then it will harm to another person or people around – around it, but, you know, what they're – it is the right for them for a smoker that they – they can smoke, but they should smoke in the right place or the place that prepared for smoker, but you should not ban them – or – that they – that they cannot smoke at all because, you know, it's what I said it is the right for them, but you know what, what I think is – a – even the smoke – even the cigarette cause an harmful – a – make them had a bad healthy, but sometime it is – you know, I'm a smoker and I feel like – I feel relax when I smoke, so you should not...

People who [***] I – I – I don't like smoking because it's bad to [***] I believe that everyone else don't – don't like it too okay and I agree with it.  Restaurant should ban smoker 100% in other country because smoking is bad.  It don't have a benefit and – and they stop every – every – everybody [***].
Okay your topic is 100% for ban smoking in my country.  Yes I think that I disagree with your topic because every people in my country smoking for a long time and I think that if you ban 100% smoking I think that tourism or foreigner don't – don't like that and – and I think that smoking is personal right.  The government cannot go across me and I think that if you ban 100%...
Okay, I agree with you because the restaurant have many people as I know students young children [***] and old – old people okay that some people don't like smoking and smoking is cause of cancer in human it's [***] smoking don't have the – don't have advantage.  It can make you [***] people don't smoke.  If you want to live long you should stop it – stop behavior and also I think people don't show smoking in restaurant for themselves and people around them and smoking can make you...
Smoking in the restaurant I think we don't do it in the restaurant because smoking is bad to our – smoking makes disadvantage to me and [***] smokers such as – that smell makes carbon dioxide and then [***] to have one [***] which is the – if people now the smoker is a kid it feel more and more disadvantage besides smoking in the restaurant makes bad air in the restaurant then many people don't come to this restaurant so smokers should not smoking in the restaurants.  Smokers should smoking in the smoking area.
Well, from the topic that – about to ban the people who are smoking in the restaurant.  Like I answer that I am disagree with this topic, because if they ban these people – this – this kind of people who are smoking then we'll cannot receive most people to eat in the restaurant but if they manage the zone – the smoking zone in the restaurant they will – this is all kind of the customer who will eat in the restaurant – restaurant.  Um, but they have to worry about the – the – the – the pollution...
Um – uh – every – um – smoking should ban in the restaurant, because – um –it's not only damage your health it's – um – also damaged the environment in the restaurant and also – um – every people around you, and – um – uh –your – uh – it's – smoking is a very bad if you are – like in a table manner if you smoke in – um – in the restaurant that you sit with – um – many people – um –I think that it's – um – um –it's  a bad – very – uh – it's a very bad manner in the restaurant, yeah, and, um – uh – it's – it's not only damage your health it's not only damage...

It will destroy their organ in – and destroy our lungs and the toxic – toxic smoke may contaminate the – the food, and not only at a restaurant that do not smoke, the other is too...
First of all, well, I agree that people shouldn't smoke in the restaurant, and in some restaurant there are a smoking area for people who is smoking, and – but not – not only in the restaurant but in school or university – just in the school they cannot smoke in the school, but in the university in some faculty or some area they have the smoking area for the student or people who does – who are smoking and cannot be quit, and I think there – there should not smoking in the public area, yes, and in other place I think that...
