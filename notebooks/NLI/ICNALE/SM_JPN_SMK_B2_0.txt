These days some people say smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  I agree this statement.  I agree with this statement, because to smoke is bad not only the people who smoke – who is smoking, but also the people around them.  So, if some people smoke in the restaurants, it is harmful for the people around them.  So, I think – I think in the – at all the restaurants in the country, we should be completely banned.  We should be – smoking should be completely banned.
It depends.  If we can divide smoke completely, it's okay.  Actually, I don't smoke, but I don't mind if somebody is smoking over in the another room, but if you can't divide smoke say smoke is coming to my room, I don't think it's good.  Actually in my laboratory many people are smoking, and I don't feel good.  So, yeah, personally of course, personally I don't like smoking, every restaurant and café banned, should be banned smoking.
I do not always agree with this opinion.  To be sure, smoking harms some people much, especially passive smoking is very – is very harmful.  Passive smoking has a very harmful effect on us.  However, there are many people who like smoking very much.  They enjoy smoking during the meeting or the eating out.  They have a right to smoke.  Therefore, we cannot always ban smoking completely.
I agree with the idea since more and more research today have made it clear that smoking is bad for health, people should not smoke at restaurants.  Restaurants are places where people enjoy having meals, and those enjoyments should not be interfered by people smoking.  I myself do not smoke and it will be bad if I smell the smokes during when I am eating at restaurants.
I agree with the statement because in Japan, people who – non-smokers, there are lot of non-smokers.  There are more non-smokers than smokers.  If smokers smoke in the restaurants, a lot of people feel uncomfortable and smoking will be – smoking cause - causes lung cancer.  So, many people – smoking will cause lung cancer, so...
I agree the statement.  Nowadays, many restaurants separate non-smokers and smokers, but this measure is not perfect because smoke can spread easily.  I think the – I think for - for smokers, the smoking is very pleasant thing, but for non-smokers, this is a very unfamiliar – no, this is a very unpleasant thing and very uncomfortable, especially while eating that those bad smell is not – not favorable.  Of course, the smoking is very bad for our health.  So, I think we should ban all smoking.
I think it is prohibited to smoke in all restaurants in Japan because - the strongest reason is I don't smoke but restaurant is so closed and there is a lot of people.  So they can make bad effect and – and in Japan, making bad effect for other people is thought bad and – the bad effect include cancer and like the illness and so, it is like killing other people.
I totally agree with the statement.  I – I believe that smoking has lots of negative effect on human body. And yeah, in fact, restaurants in Britain does not allow people to smoke in the restaurants at all.  And the – the – the worst thing is if someone smokes it will harm somebody else's health as well.  And no one has the right to damage their health, you know.  And – and the negative effect is very, very serious.  Some people can die of cancer due to the smoke.  Therefore, I believe smoking should be banned in the restaurant – all the restaurants.
I don't disagree with this opinion because I don't like smoking but smoking people should be protected, so restaurant is public space and it is – it can be all the people is feeling good but I – I – I – I suggest the right space.  So all the people can't be happy but some people can be happy and it is good to ban smoking or separate smoking.
I – I disagree with this statement because I don't smoke.  Some people it's – they are found to smoke, smoking – smoking.  I don't smoke but all restaurant is too much to do think so.  So, I don't think smoke – smoking is [****] because [****].  Smoking – so, should [****].  No.
I agree because the smoking is harmful for not just smoker but also for non-smoker around – people around smoker because – and the – non-smoker was affected by smoker.  And I have another reason and in restaurant people want to enjoy their taste but smell of smoke is make the smell bad so non-smoker are harmed and also they can't enjoy their meal...
Well, I – I agree to that statement.  To smoke – to smoke depend on the person on themselves.  But so if we want to speak – if we want to smoke so it is – it is – it is free if want.  But it may disturb other who don't want to smoke so in public place if you – so in public place smoking may – smoking may disturb other who don't want to smoke.  So if – so if they want to smoke in their – in their own space not to...
I – I agree no smoking in – I agree no smoking because – because there are not known good things with smoking and third reason is I hate smoking and third reason is no smoking cost – cut lot of cost.  If you smoke for cigarette for one day maybe you – maybe one person smoke 120 cigarettes for one month it means it costs ¥3000.  It's a little high – it's ex – expensive for me.  Maybe, it is use – useful to – to spend the money for eating or your hobbies.  Maybe...
I agree this claim.  These days, there are many people who do not smoke and for them the smell of cigarette is very bad particularly we go to restaurant to eat food and for me the smell of cigarette often make the taste of food bad.  And nowadays the number of people who is smoking is fewer and fewer so thinking about non-smoker is important.  And also I is good for smoker because thinking about their – their healthiness, not smoking is good and – so when smoking...
I agree with the idea that people – the smoking in public – in restaurant in public ban completely because – because I focus on – focus on the taste of dish and – and harm – and harm of passive smoking.  Firstly, if someone smoke during – during eating something it – it harms – it harms the taste of dish and if you smoke after – after 18...
I can't agree.  Actually, I don't smoke and also I don't like the people who smoke but I think we can't – we can't buy it.  There are many people who likes smoking so but – but there are some people who don't like smoke so we should divide the space of the restaurant and the people who want to smoke go to the second – second floor and the people who don't like smoke – smoking they should go to the first floor like this.  So I can't agree the completely...
I really agree with because first smoking is harmful to human race.  And what matters of smoking is secondary smoking – secondary smoking is harmful to people who don't want to smoking – don't want to smoke and it is – it is more harm in – in than outside.  Moreover, in the restaurant where people eat and drink, smoking may break the framework of disease.  So I think smoking in the restaurant is obviously banned.
I think it should be banned completely.  By smoking doesn't work completely in the restaurant but may spread around – around the restaurant.  That's why it should be banned completely.  Restaurant is a place to eat food and enjoy meal.  That's why banning completely is very essential for the restaurant and also smoking is – has a bad effect on human body.  It causes many illness that's why many people doesn't want to smoke so banning completely essentially for our human body.
I – because I am not – I am not smoker so if – if smoking in the restaurant is bad, I – I [***] preserved.  But it's – I think it's difficult to ban smoking in the restaurant because it's – it's ignoring – ignoring human right in country.  So I think restaurant must have more no smoking area but...
I think the smoking should be banned completely at the restaurant.  There are two points – there are two reasons.  The first point is it is bad for the smoker's health.  I think do something – smoking cause a lot of disease, for example, lung cancer.  So it is not good for smoker's health.  And second reason is that it is bad for the people around smoker.  Smoking is not only – smoking is bad for not only smokers but...
I think smoking should be banned in the restaurants because these days not so many people smoke, and smoking is harmful.  When I was in Canada, smoking is banned in all the restaurants, and people in that country didn't have any wonder so I thought – that was really nice if smoking is banned in Japan also.

I think smoking should not be banned all – at all the place because smoking – it's proved that smoking is bad for human health for smokers and also person nearby.  How – however, we also think about smoke – smokers, why they smoke.  If we ban all smoking in all the place, this will ruin the right of smoke – smokers and this also affect the sales of – of cafe or restaurant who many – where many smokers go.  And smoker – no – not – it's true that...
I don't agree with the opinion.  Surely, it's very important to stop smoking because it's very bad to – to health and it's very expensive to buy it.  But if the smoking people can't use the restaurant freely, maybe they don't buy cigarette or – and maybe the government – government can't take the tax from cigarette, so I think restaurant should be divided the smoking area and not smoking area.  It...
I don't agree with the statement because it is – smoking in the restaurant is bad for health and bad for our eating time.  Smoking smell is – make our food bad or our feeling may – will be bad in that smoking area.  So – so smoking is – must be banned, but some people have to smoke because of their stress, so I can't hope all smoke is banned in restaurant or some other places, but accept - it is accept for...
I am disagree with this statement.  If this statement says that abandon smoking in all public places, I will be agreed with that.  However, this statement says that abandon smoking in whole country, that's why I'm – I disagree with this statement.  Because to smoke – to have smoke – to smoking is according to – according to someone's choice.  Therefore, if it's not in the public place or restaurant or something like that place is which other people are...


I don't disagree smoking prohibit – prohibit all over the country because I don't like – no diversity place and I think the country need many options.  So, they are divided smoking place and nonsmoking place.  I don't like tobacco, but strictly prohibit is the country makes more strict country.  So, I don't like strict country and they should make up diversity and kind to smokers.  Smokers have difficulty to quit smoking.  So, I think they need to place to smoke.  So...





I agree with the statement because I hate smoking.  There is two reasons, that first is it smells is so bad and second is smoking is attributed to – contributed to cancer, and I think second reason is a controversial, there is – some people says that smoking is not regarding – regarding – regard – regard cancer, but first reason is I think very robust.  So that smoke – that smoking or that – that smells make me very uncomfortable in restaurant.  I think it makes – it makes dishes more bad.





I – I disagree what they are saying.  I think it's okay to – I think there is no need to ban smoking completely at restaurants in companies because there are – there are – there are so many people who smokes – smokes for – for if they're stressed.  Certainly, smoking is not good for health – health – not only the hea – health of the person who smokes but also person around them.  That there are cafes or restaurants, the – the smoking area was – is separated.  So I think as long as they're separated...





I – I will be – I – I agree with this statement that smoking should be fined at all restaurants in the country because first reason is if country – country ban – ban smoking at all restaurants, I – I believe the number of people who are smoking would decrease.  It is important and good for the country.  And another reason is that many people enjoy their food at the restaurants but smoking – smoking – smoking effects on the taste of restaurant food, so people who are not smoking cannot enjoy the food naturally.



I disagree that, uh, smoking is banned, uh, restaurant and anywhere because cigarette is – some people love cigarette.  Cigarette gives happy for the persons but if the smoking is banned, the peo – the – the people lost their happy in lifetime and – in lifetime.  This is not – uh, not good thing, uh, so I think, uh, smoker pre – uh, um, whether...
These days some people say smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  I agree with the - this statement because to - smoking is bad not – for not only the people who is smoking but also the people around them.  To smoke is harmful for the people who is smoking of course bad.  Around him – around them – people around them have to absorb the smoke.  So, it is very harmful.  So, I think smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  Thank you.
I think smoking it should be banned in the all restaurant and cafeteria in this country because it's very difficult to divide smoke between the smoking area and no smoking area, and yeah, relatively it's – usually it's in the one big room, so it's very difficult.  In case of laboratory, it's many rooms, so you can decide which room is for smoking and not for smoking, by the restaurant, the cafeteria it's very difficult to divide the air atmosphere.  So, smoking, it should be banned.  Of course, it's - it's personally but should be banned in this country.
I do not necessarily agree with this opinion.  Certainly, smoking does many people much harm.  Especially, passive smoking is very harmful.  However, there are many people who love smoking.  We have a right to smoke or not to smoke.  We cannot prevent smokers from smoking in the restaurants.  We cannot stop – we cannot completely stop them from smoking in the restaurants.  We have to consider this matter very seriously.
I agree with the idea because more and more research have made it clear that smoking is bad for human health.  Since restaurants are places where people enjoy eating, their enjoyments should not be interfered by heartless people who smoke.  I hear that in United Kingdom already all smoking are banned at every restaurants in the country.  So, Japan should always follow the law like those of United Kingdom.
I agree with the statement.  I have two reasons.  First, in Japan, there are more people, more non-smoker - non-smokers than smokers.  So, if smokers smoke in the restaurants, a lot of people feel uncomfortable.  Second, smoking will cause lung cancer.  So, it is not good for smokers and non-smokers' health.  So, smoking is not – smoking is not good thing for many peoples.
I agree the statement.  Nowadays, many restaurant separate smokers and non-smokers, but this measure is not perfect because smoke can easily spread.  The smoker can – can smoke outside the restaurant, but smoking inside the restaurant is very bad thing for non-smokers because while eating the bad smell is very harmful, and of course, the tobacco is very harmful for our health.  That's why the all ban is necessary for the restaurant.  I think the smoking in the restaurant is very bad thing.
I think smoking in restaurants in Japan is prohibited because in – in restaurant there is a lot of people including children and it is closed.  So, it has caused bad effect and bad effect includes disease or aging.  So, it can be called killing other people and so it should be prohibited.  And more strong idea of us – of me is I don't smoke.  So it should be – it – it should be prohibited, I think.
I totally agree with this statement.  I think smoking should be banned in all of the restaurants in Japan.  It is mainly because smoking has a huge negative effect on humans – human body.  According to BBC every year more than 30 – 30% of people die of cancer which is caused by, you know, smoking.  Maybe that's why in Britain all the restaurant, maybe all – all the restaurants have banned smoking, you know, in public.  So I – considering from this fact I think it's not too drastic to take an action, take the same action in Japan and I also believe it's necessary to do that.  That's why I believe it should be banned in all of the restaurants in Japan.
I don't disagree with this opinion because I don't like smoking but restaurant is public space.  So, all the people can't be happy but some people can be happy is good.  So, I suggest separate space is good.  Some people smoking and some people don't smoking, so they separate it and don't-smoking people can't get smoke.  So they feel happy.  And smoking people can be feel good, so because they don't criticized.
I disagree with this statement because like, like my – in my position, I like, I like playing basketball and like sports.  And people who like smoking is like that, they like smoking and – and all restaurants have banned smoking.  For them they have no fun to live.  And I think, all restaurants ban smoking is – is not good idea.  So, separate the smoking area and – like nonsmoking area is a good idea and so I disagree with it.
I agree that smoking should be completed ban on all country because smoking is harmful for body.  It is fact and smoking is not just – smoking is harmful not just for smoker but also nonsmoker if around the smoker and in addition to people who came to the restaurant want to enjoy their meal but – and they – they enjoy their – enjoy the smell of the meal.  However, the smell of smoke is damaged the good smell of the meal.  So nonsmoker be affected not only for body but smell.
Well, I agree to that statement.  All people have right just to decide to smoke or not.  So if one – if one who want to – who want to smoke it is – it is own to smoke but if – but if they smoke in public space, it may – it may – it may make others feel bad who want – who don't want to smoke.  So who want – who want to smoke should – should smoke in their own – in their own space not other make – others make bad – others make feel bad.
I agree no smoking because there are some reasons.  The first reason is that smoking has no good things [***] smokers.  If you smoke in a r restaurant, maybe a lot of persons who don't – who hate the smoking feel bad and other reason is this, smoking let the big – big disease like some big disease and third reason is smoking led costing cut – cutting the lot of cost you smoke for cigarette one day maybe you can have the cost for ¥3000 for 1 month.  You can...
And I – I think that restaurant is very important because restaurant is a place to eat food and I want – I am not smoker and I – I do not want to smell the cigarette – smell of cigarette so that is because it's very – it makes food taste very bad and I want smoker did not smoking that is because for thinking – I want them thinking about non-smoker and...
I agree with the idea that smoking in restaurant is completely – should – should be completely banned in public restaurant because – because the harm of – because the harm of – harm of passive smoking is so – so – so huge for people especially for children and ladies – pregnant ladies.  If – if divide the area for smoking people and non-smoking people but even – even smoking people receive – receive the harm of...
I can't agree it.  Actually, I don't smoke and also I don't like smoking and I don't like the people who smoke.  But there are some people who likes smoking and also there are many people like me and we shouldn't ban smoking.  We should divide the place, I mean, divide this place and the people who want to smoke go to the up floor and the people who don't like smoking stay at the first floor like this.  This is the best idea I think.
I really agree with it.  Because what matters of smoking is secondary smoking.  Secondary smoking is harmful to also people who don't want to smoke.  And smoking is more harmful in the outside.  Moreover, smoking in the restaurant where people eat and drink, it may break framework of disease, so I think smoking in the restaurant should be completely banned in all countries.  It may [***] I...
I think it should be banned completely because [***] smoking doesn't work at the restaurant.  That smoke spread around the restaurant so even if you don't want to smoke you have to – you have to breathe in the smoke.  So banning is completely is important for restaurant and restaurant is closed – close place so we can't escape to smoke.  The restaurant is a place to eat food and enjoy the meal that's why banning it is very essential for everyone.  Also, smoke – smoking has a bad affect on...
I am not smoker so if there is no smoking area, I – I am little glad but it's – I think it's difficult to ban smoking in – in the restaurant because it's ignoring human rights and as long as I don't face smoke, I am not – I don't care of that.  So now if – I think it is needed to make good differentiation of smoking.
I think should – smoking should be banned completely at the restaurant.  There are two reasons.  The first reason is that it is bad for the smoker's health.  Smoking can cause a lot of disease, for example, lung cancer so it is bad for smoker's health.  And also the second reason is that smoking is bad for the people around smokers.  For example, at the restaurant, we can't escape the smoking if some people smoke – if someone smokes.  Smoking is bad for their health.  So I think...
I think smoking should be banned in the restaurant because these days – people are aware that smoking is harmful and there are not so many people smoking in Japan.  When I was in Canada, no restaurant are allowed to smoke, and I thought that is really nice because I don't smoke, and I hate smoking.  So, I think, smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in Japan.

I think smoking should not be banned in all restaurants because – because this will ruin the right of smokers.  It‘s true that smoking will harm people's health, smokers and also a person nearby.  However, prohibit – prohibiting smoking will affect the sales of restaurants.  We – we can – I think owners of the restaurant should choose whether to - whether prohibit it or not.  We don't...
I don't agree with the opinion.  Now the Japanese government is very –depends on the tax from cigarettes, so it's – many restaurant are – many restaurant are banned to – banned of smoking, many smokers stop buying cigarette and try to stop smoking.  And – so I think it's enough to divide the restaurant, smoking area and not smoking area to – for the Japanese government and for our life, it's enough I think.  And more – also it needs more development of the...
I don't agree with that statement because restaurant must be the place for relax for all the peoples.  We can't make difficulty for smokers.  That's why I – I don't agree with that statement.  But in hospital, no smoking – I'm sorry.  Smoking must be banned because smoke – smoke is very bad for health.  In the hospital, patients are very weak.  That's why they can't keep their conditions in smoking.
Sometimes that if - abandoning smoking can be move - it can be – become worst – worst situation like in other countries, for example, many other – some other countries have no people to get drug for example [***] in Japan, people – some people have smoking, but some of them not so much have drug, so I'm just worried about if abandon – if they abandon smoking...


I don't – I don't agree that prohibit smoking because I smoking – to stop smoking is difficult to smokers.  So, I think they need a place to smoke more.  So, I don't agree to smoking is good activity, but I think they need a place to smoke.  Uhh – they – second hand smoke affection [***] is bad to nonsmokers.  They need – uhh – place to smoking place and nonsmoking place and we should make diversity place to smoker and nonsmokers.  Of course I don't like tobacco smell but...





I think no smoking in the restaurant is – is needed to be required or needs to be first, I have two reasons.  First is smells from smoking is so bad and that makes dishes, which is served in the restaurant, more bad and second is smoking is contributed to – contributed to cancer.  I think second one is controversial question but first one is robust because I can – if – if persons who are sitting next to me in restaurant started smoking, then I can't – I can't...





I disagree with this theme.  There is no need to smoke – there is no need to ban smoking completely at the restaurants and company because there are so much people – so many people who have – who are smoking to ease their stress.  Certainly, smoking is not good for health, not only person who smokes but also person around them but if we complete – if we ban smoking completely at the restaurant, there is no – the people – the smoking people where should – should they go.  As long – I think as long as it says like it no smoking area and smoking area, I think it's okay – everything where we...




 Speaker
I agree with this statement.  I – there are two reasons for this.  First reason is that if I keep on smoking at all restaurants, I – I think number of people who are smoke – who are smoking will decrease.  It is very good for the country's economy because if there – if people – if people stop smoking, the number of people would become – become decrease – were decrease.  Second reason many people enjoy their food at the restaurant but smoking affect the taste of restaurant food so people cannot enjoy their food, so if – if smoking is banned at all restaurants, people enjoy more at the restaurant so that's why I agree.



I disagree the opinion.  Uh, some people love cigarette, cigarette gives, uh, happy for the person, but if the cigarette is banned - they – those are happy.  So, I think we must make a room, no cigarettes – cigarettes room or no-smoking room so, uh, non-smoking people and smoking people are – sh – share, uh, lives and otherwise recognized smoke or no-smoking so this is, uh...
