These days some people say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, and I think so because through part-time job, we –we can learn a lot of things.  In my case, now I am working at the cram school.  I am teaching English, mathematics, history, and so on.  It is difficult to convey my opinion to my students, but it is very, very good experience for me.  So, we can learn a lot of things from part-time job.  It is good.  That's all.  Thank you.
I think it depends on the person.  If your parents is very rich, you don't have to work.  You have to study.  So, you don't have to part-time job, but your parents is not so rich, so you have to work.  It's very important to work and help your parents.  And it's your - if you have  --  you are very - very healthy, it's okay to work at night and study daytime, but if you are not healthy, it's better to study at daytime and rest at night.  If work, part-time job, it had bad influence to your job work, study, it's not good.
I agree with this opinion.  There are three reasons.  First, young people can learn something important about the relationship between elderly people and them.  Second, young people can learn the importance of money through part-time job.  Third, young people can use polite words, especially to elderly people.  It is said that these days young people cannot know how to use polite words.  Therefore, this experience make them feel the importance of part-time job.
I agree with the idea that it is important for college students to have a part-time job since the increasing amount of the tuition fee.  It is becoming harder and harder to pay the tuition fee by yourself, and it is necessary to gain the additional money by having the part-time job.  There is an opinion that university students could borrow some scholarship, but more and more people are – there is increasing amount of people who can't give back the money they have borrowed.
I agree with the statement because many college students in Japan don't know the rules of – don't know the rules in society.  If students have a part-time job, they can know the – lot of them can know a lot of rules, some of rules, for example, rules.  Second, they can – in college their world is very narrow, so...
I agree this statement because by having a part-time job, we can – we can learn many things, important thing – important things.  For example, we can know the - what job there are and - which means we can know – we can learn – can learn the society better.  And I think as the - having part-time type - part-time job too much is very bad thing because - but – but – and – to - to have a part-time job, moderate is important.  And if we don't have the part-time job, there are many...
I agree with this opinion.  It is important for college student to have a part-time job.  Because I think – I think we can't keep – keep – keep relying on our parents and a part-time job will help our searching for good job for us.  So I think it – it is important.  I've – I've worked on drug [***] company, so I don't want – I found that I don't want to included by that company.
I agree with this statement.  I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I have two reasons for this, money and social experience.  First of all, generally speaking, in the world, people who are over 18 years old are regarded as adult.  And, you know, in Japan as well, in here students start studying at the university if – on 20 years – 18 years old.  So if – if they want – if they want to do something they must earn money by themselves.  They have to stop depending on their family.  Second - secondly, they should have the social experience as well.  That's why I agree with the statement.
I don't disagree with this opinion because our parents pay money for our time and to go to college.  So if we go to – if we have a part-time job it is to give money for – for very cheap.  So, I don't disagree with this opinion.  Student is – student have to study and it is so important.  It...
I am – I am not agree with this statement because for college students learning is their job and it's very important for them than earning a little money to them.  But if they are poor or don't have money it's necessary to do the part-time job.  But I – my opinion is not – not important but necessary if they have – have necessary to do it, I think they have to do the part-time job.
I agree because when student work in part-time job, they can manner or how to respond their customer, those skills are needed when they graduated their college.  And moreover by working part – in part time job, they learn the difficulty of making money by their own – on their own.  Before they start work, they – all the money they have is...
I agree to – to the statement of student have – student have a part time job because it is a good experiment – it is good experiment that student can have time to work.  Just – just to learn in class is – is not effective in social.  It can...
I agree this opinion because some reasons do the part time job is good chance for knowing how to earn money and it's very nice situation to relationship with other person such like boss or your co-workers and maybe – maybe do the part time – do part time job teach you how – how you – how you don't know the world, there are lot of things what you don't know about the world and – and part time jobs give you little money but if you do – do the normal job maybe you...
I agree this claim because children need more money because university student go to – someone go to school and go to need more books and more time to play.  And someone go to – go to drinking so they need many much – lot of money so university student should do a part time job.  Of course, it is important to study but...
I disagree with the idea that for college student it is important to work at part time job because the most important thing for college student is to study and to widen their perspective of – perspective in – in light of – light of their major.  If – if a student too much focus on working part time job, they don't – they cannot focus – cannot concentrate on their study.  I know some student who can...
I agree.  I am a tutor and I teach math in Japanese and English for the students, I mean, elementary school student.  I can enjoy talking them and also I can learn from them for example they are – they don't – because, how can I say, they don't know how to – how to be taught – how to be taught.  They can't – they can't understand well...
I agree with it because college student can have many kind of experience through part time job.  Of course, once they have to do [***] is to study of college.  However, part time jobs activities outside college can [***] their work.  So part time job – they work with and interact with more people than they are only in their universities.  It is important for them to meet many people and share ideas with them.  I think – I think it – it has important as...
I think doing the part time job it's good for university student because doing the part time job give us many important experiences.  For example, we can know the social habit or manner.  And we can learn how to deal with customer and how to deal with customer's friend just like it's very important and precious experiences.  I admit that doing person job too much, doing everyday it's very bad for university life.  We cannot study enough and so on.  But once a week or twice a week is good and right for university student and we can earn money university student...
I think it is very important for college student to do part time job because doing part time job, you can know what you can do or you can't – what you can't do.  You would – you can know your weak point.  For example, I do part time job in community store and I noticed that I am weak in working early in the morning and if I – I – I overcome that, I have good...
I agree.  I think the college student should have the part time job.  This is because of course this college study is very important but from the part time job, we can learn a lot of things for example how do you communicate – how do you communicate with people around us.  It is very important skill.  We should value this skill and we – the college student have a lot of things they want to do.  And...
I agree with the topic because I'm also have part time job to get money, and it's important for us to know how hard to get money, and it's very nice experience for students.  And I also made new friends there, and the money I got, I will – I will use that money to travel along the rail because that is my hobby and – my parents also told me to work up somewhere –somewhere to get money to understand.

I think Jap – Japanese college students should do part-time job because we will be one – one of the – one of the most experienced before working – working.  For part-time - we can use for – very good experience by working part-time job because – because we can learn about – about society – society and we cannot study by this – about this.  Second, we – we – we can choose – choose or know which – which job is suitable for – for our future.  We – we can try many kind of – many kind of jobs.
I agree with the – because I agree with the importance of – have – of that opinion, because I think we can experience so many kinds of jobs by – during part-time job and also we can know how hard it is to earn money and moreover we can meet many people like we can't meet in our university.  And we know how many people are working so hard because they have – they don't have – they don't have their...
I agree with the statement to some extent because it is necessary to live especially for people who have hometown for far – far from here, for example my hometown is Ishikawa.  It is very far from here, so I have to stay alone and I have to prepare some gadgets to live and I have to prepare my house.  It is – it costs a lot for me.  That's why I – I need to work in this area.  So, if I can't work in my college, I can't stay –sorry, I can't make a living in this town.
I'm agree with this statement because students needs money for daily life and also school during his or her student life, especially students who don't have any special care from their caregivers like their parents and so forth.  And we have some type of scholarship, but it is very difficult to get scholarship without any paybacks these days.  And that is actually necessary to do a part-time job to get money for...


I think for part-time job it – it's good opportunity to students to learn social – social and they can just social skills to survive – uhh – company and I had the part-time jobs many times and I work for in company say really good time to learn what is job and so I saw a person who work for a company and I think it is really difficult to get money and college students have many times to work part-time.  So, they should...





I agree with the statement that some university student have to do a part-time jobs and in my experience I am – I had – I have experience of part-time job, for example, when I was a freshman, I am studied to do part-time job at convenience store.  In Japan, there is many convenience store and I do many kind of jobs, something like putting bottles to vender machine or doing – or make – or make shop McQueen or selling something like fried chicken or hamburger or...





First of all, I disagree to – to college students working – taking part-time job because if they work so much they won't have – they wouldn't have time to study.  Certainly, it is important to learn how this society works – works – and work in – and doing part-time job that as student it is more important to study, so if we work so much – work too much – if we spend too much time just do part-time job we won't – we wouldn't have time to study, so I think it's...





I agree with this – this topic.  I did – I think it is important to for college student to do a part-time job because there were three reasons for that.  First reason is talking with older people is very good experience for college student because usually they talk with – with their friends and don't have experience with – have experience talking with older people.  And secondly, they learn – they will learn responsibility by doing a part-time job because they will – they will get money and so they have to take responsibility for that.  So, they can learn responsibility and partly there is...



I am agree with the opinion it well – it is important, uh, for college students to do part-time job because I think the part-time job is for college student is very, very, uh, important and – important – uh, important things, uh, because once working with for students no – uh – no, for – for students – not only academic, uh...
These days some people say it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I think so.  Of course, if you – you do many, many part-time job, it is not good because you lose – you will lose your time, but for - through part-time job, we can learn a lot of things.  Now, I am working at the cram school.  It is difficult for me to convey my opinion to my students, but from this experience, I can learn a lot of things.  So, to have a part-time job is very good things, I think.  Thank you.
It – it – it depends on the person.  If your parents is not too rich you have to – it's - it's very important to work for you, but your parents is very poor, doesn't have enough money to pay to your school, it's very important for you to work at day or night and study another time.  So, personally, it's very important to work because my parents is not poor, but I have to work to my life and school tuition.  So, yeah, yeah, it – it depends on the person.
I agree with this opinion because young people can learn the important three points from part-time job.  They can learn the following points:  First, the relationship between elderly people and them; second, the importance of money; and finally, how to use polite words.  By learning these points, young people can develop their successful life in their career.  I am sure this experience leads to their – their success in career.
I agree with the idea since so many students are – students - increasing number of students cannot pay the money they have borrowed by scholarship, it is a good – good idea to have a part-time job and compensate for the money you can't afford by yourself.  Additionally, you can have – you can experience new type of experience by – from the workplace of your part-time job, and this experience may...
I agree with the statement because many college students in Japan don't know the rules of – don't know the rules in society.  If students have a part-time job, they can know the - lot of them can know a lot of rules, some of rules, for example, the rules.  Second, they can – in college their world is very narrow, so...
I agree the statement because by having a part-time job, we can learn many important things.  For example, what kind of job there are in the society or how hard to make money, and I don't think that doing a part-time job too much is good.  It harm our life and we can – we cannot – we cannot study enough, but moderate job is important.  And – and if we don't have a part-time job, we cannot – we cannot kill time in university students.
I agree with the opinion.  It is important to do part-time job for college students because I think part-time job will help our – help our researching for good job for themselves.  And we can't rely on our parents.  So we earn some money for living.  For example, I have – I have worked on drug company called [***] and I found it was a good – it is bad job for me and I found I don't want – I don't want to be included by such a company.  So I think it is important for our – for us college student...
I agree with this statement.  I think it's very important for university students do a part-time job.  I have two reasons for this, money and social experience.  First of all, generally speaking people who are over 18 years old are regarded as adult and the university – university students as well.  And if they want to do something like a trip and having - buying some clothes and, you know, eating some nice food, they have – their – their duty is to make money by themselves.  And second of all, they can get lots of social experience through the part-time job.  For instance, for me, I used – I used to work for – I used to work as a cram school teacher and I got lots of experience from my senior members.  And I know - now I know how to act in front of elder people.
I don't disagree with this opinion because our parents pay so expensive money to go to school and to study and this time.  We can only – we can only this time study and if we started job and we – we have little time to study.  So, it is important to study and it is only time to study is just students.  So I don't disagree with this opinion.  We have to do only this time, only student time.
I don't – I don't think, I don't think, I – I don't – I don't agree with part-time job is best important for college students because studying is, I think studying is for their job and it's more important than part-time job.  And if they – if they are – if they are poor or are like have no money they - I think, they have to do part-time job and earn money but it – if they have to, necessary – if it's necessary to do the part-time job I think they have to do that but their economy is – but I don't think it's best important for them.
I agree because by working part time job university student can learn social manner and how to respond their customer, those skills are needed after graduated their college and moreover they can learn the difficulty of making money on their own.  Before working, all the money they had was own their parent and they didn't know how the making money – how to making money is difficult.  Those experience will be worthful for...
I think – I think for university – university student to have a part time job is very important because to work – to work with other areas is – is very important for them.  University we can learn – we can learn and play I think but it is with – with same AD [***].  So for part time – part time job, it is – is good to have working experience with other AD and [***] and would be – would study something from other AD workers.  It will be – it will be a good experience that cannot – that cannot we got from the university education.  And...
I agree this opinion because there are some reasons.  First reason is that I – I think it is a good chance to know how – how – how to earn lot of money and second reason is that part time job is a good situation to learn – learn relationship with other person such like boss or co-workers or some other persons and the third reason is that for college student it is a good chance to do a lot of – lot of – a lot of kind of jobs.  Part time job is only a part time job so you can do the lot of – a lot of jobs such like plan school teacher or...
I also agree to this claim and university student should study a lot of – lot but it is not only academic but also social – social one and if you do a part-time job, you – you can learn lot of things about social – social things and for example you – you make – you can build human relationship with more old people and it is very important because university student often meet people who – who...
I disagree with the idea that for college student it is important to work at part time job because the most important things in college or university is to study and widen the perspective of – perspectives of in light – perspective in light of their major.  I know – I know some examples – examples and students who cannot graduate their – graduate from their university because they – they too much focus on – focus and concentrate on working part time – part time job.  If...
I agree.  I am a tutor and I teach math and Japanese to my student I mean elementary school student.  I teach Japanese and math student but also I learn many things from them.  For example, the first time they didn't know how to ask question to me but finally they can say what the meaning of this or how to – how to do this like that and I think we can be the good friend so if student...
I think there are two points in part time jobs.  First, college student can get money for their college expense for example.  Second, college student can have many kinds of experience to part time jobs.  Part time jobs activities outside college can enrich their work.  Through job activities, they work and interact with more people than they are in only – only in their universities.  It is important for student to meet many people and share ideas with them.  In my opinion, it is important – as important as...
I think doing a part time job is good for us because doing part time job give us many important experiences.  For example, we can know how to – we can know social habit or manners and we can learn how to deal with customer and customer friend and also we can earn money.  University student needs money for playing around or study – or studying or living life.  That's why we can earn money this is very important point.  And I admit that doing part time job everyday is bad for study but twice a week or once a week is moderate and good to do...
As long as you can – you – you are ought – you ought to get part time job in your college – college student because it's important to know that you have – what you are good at or not.  For example, I am working in community store early in the morning but if I don't – I don't sleep enough before the working day, I can't do good performance.  I could – now I know I am not good at sleeping...
I think the college student should have the part time job.  Of course, spending too much time doing part time job is not good but from the part time job we can learn a lot of things for example how do you communicate with people around us.  It is a very important skill.  The college student have a lot of things they want to do for example [***] abroad doing something funny and to do so they need a lot of money.  So they should money by themselves.  So I think the college student should...
I think it is important for students to have part time job because if we have part time jobs, we can experience a lot of things and make new friends there and get money also.  And we understand how hard to get money and how hard working is.  Students have to study and, I know, but we also have to work to know a lot of things.

We – we – we can – we can learn about a little – a little – little things from – from part – part-time jobs including importance of money.  Many – many people have not worked before in high school or junior high school and this – this – this working experience will – will force people to manage wants, money – plan, money plan in their lives.  And - so, we can learn about importance of money.  Then we – we can also learn about job...
I agree with that opinion.  There are three reasons.  One is that we can experience so many kinds of jobs by doing part-time jobs – part-time jobs.  And number two is that we can know how hard it is to earn money in short time or in long time.  And the last reason is that we can meet a lot – a lot of people like we can't – we can't know in the university.  And we can learn a lot from the part-time jobs and we can ready for the job hunting by doing part-time – part-time job.
I agree with the statement to some extent, because it is essential to live in this area, especially for people who have hometown far from here.  In my case, my hometown is Ishikawa.  It is south part of Japan.  That's why I have to live in here alone.  It is cost a lot for me.  So for me, it is – to working – to work in this area is essential.  In contrast, but – but it is very – it takes a lot of time for me, so I cannot take enough time to study my specialties, so it is very difficult problem for me.
Moreover – the reason for this is moreover that student may know the society life after the graduation.  It will give some kind of practice for having jobs, especially – actually, sometimes you may be able to continue the same job as a full-time worker like some of my friends such as to become some kind of working for – working as a journalist for example.  So, it may be able to – to be the step or the next step after the graduation.


I think part-time job is good for college students.  College students have many times in college life.  So, they should use that time for work because they can learn more and learn more about social company and get social skills and so am I – I work for any company and many – I have many part-time jobs and it was really great time to learn what is the job.  I also worked for the many company and it was good time and I also [***] work for the many company and I realized it is difficult to get money and it was good to...





I agree with the statement, so I think part-time – I think part-time job has to be required for university students for – because I think by doing part-time job, student will know about society more and more.  For example, the students who are living in all the university, I think they are not – they – they don't know society well.  For example, by doing part-time job at the convenience store, they will know there is many people who are working or who are doing something like many – many kinds of jobs which is...





First of all, I disagree to – disagree to college student to – to do part-time jobs, because if students – students start – students work – student work so much to – student spend so much time to – to do part-time job, their – their part-time job, they would have no time to study.  Secondly, I think it's important to learn – learn how – how this society work through the part-time job, but it is more important to student to study.  So, I think this – I think college students should concentrate – concentrate on their studies, so I disagree with this – with this theme.





I – I agree with this topic.  I – I will have – I – I want to talk about three reasons model [***].  Firstly, with – talking with all these people is good – good experience for – for college students.  They can learn more about – about social – social situations.  And secondly learning responsibility is necessary for college students before – before working – before working.  Then they would get money instead, so they have to take – they have to take responsibility and third reason is overcome – making friends by part-time job lots of college students and as a young people on...



I am agree with it is important, uh, for college students to do part-time job because part-time job  --  to do part-time job is very, very ex - life experience for college students.  College students, uh, often, uh  --  usually do their studies, but, uh, not working - everyone, uh, experiences, uh, not only, uh, is important, not only studying but also working, uh, is very, uh, important for college student, and college students will work -- 
