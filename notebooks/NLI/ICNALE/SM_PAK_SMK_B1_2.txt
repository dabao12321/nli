Smoking – I agree – I agree with the topic that smoking should be banned because smoking damage the health of the person.  The psychology of the person is affected.  The person think – the person becomes lazy and the smoking has hazardous affect on the health and it is a really bad habit.  The student – the students do not focus on the studies because of addiction of smoking.  The smoking – the person who smokes become really lazy.  The other person do not like his company and the – the person will look really dull and his eyes become puffy and the lungs – his lungs affected and the – his organs stop working and the person have to – the person does not work properly and his health – his sleeping cycle is also affected if he does not continue...
Okay, now – now our topic is that the smoking should be prohibited in all countries, so I am agree with this topic and I say that it should be prohibited in all our daily work because the smoking is injurious to health.  It is not good for anyone, not for children, not for a young boy, not for old people because if you continuously smoke in your life, it – it cuts your 10 years life.  It is not good for your health and I know any one advantage of it, it is just a wastage of time, wastage of your life.  It is the cause of cancer, the cancer of lungs, the cancer of your mouth.  Even the people who sell the cigarettes or the smoke - -smoking, they also have written on their item that it is not good for your health and if – and one saying this, it means that it is not good for health, that's why...
Yes, smoking should be banned.  It has a very hazardous affect on the life of the person who smokes.  It is not an appreciated activity.  Smoking is not only for dangers for the smokers but it has a potential to do harm to the person  --  to the persons who remain in the company of smokers.  Before we talk about that smoking should be banned, it should be banned but there are many other things which should be seen before we talk about banning of smoking.  For example, wine, alcohol and drugs, these are the things which in many countries, especially in developed countries, they are legal around the globe.  These should be  --  smoking is a step which leads to these immoral activities but since smoking has no match with these things.  For a smoker, it is real -- 
I am totally disagree from smoking because it bad effect of smoking cannot be relating the concerning health issue.  Nicotine is the main source of people developing lung cancer, which has become an epidemic to poorer nations.  Passive effect of smoking is also another subject to count.  Medical researches show that a non-smoking person living along with the smoker has a great chance of getting lungs cancer too, and this is called passive smoking.  Usually, it is seen that children of smoking couple are more likely to start smoking early than those whose parents are non-smokers and the eventually effect of...

Especially, it is very common in teenagers which is – smoking is really bad for health and when students do smoking, when adopt smoking, they become a disease and they become – when they become addicted to that.

And it should be banned in every country and it could – it could be stopped by making rehabilitation centers and...
Smoking is really a very bad habit.  It is not only harmful for the smoker but also for the whole society.  Smokers are such kind of persons who are facing psychological disorders because a wise person could not use to smoke.  Smoking become a monster today and it creates problem not only in particular countries but all the world is facing this threat.  Actually, this trend of smoking starts in developed countries and became a fashion but now we can observe the  --  that every country of the world is worried because of the harmful effect of smoking.  Smoking effect the health of smoker very badly.  It may cause the various diseases of lungs and most notably it cause the mouth cancer.
I totally disagree to the smoking.  First of all, I will tell you that everyone knows that smoking is very dangerous thing, yet people are involving themselves.  When we – when we totally involved in smoking, this is lot of problem.  Most of the people, all smokers, their liver are damaged and they face lot of problems and that – and problems that breathing.  In Pakistan, most of the people are belong to lower class and when they totally involved in smoking, so they do not take brush properly.  I think that you should control the spreading of smoking – control all over the country in world.  Lot of companies are merged how make cigarette...

In my opinion, smoking should be banned nowadays.  Smoking causes him a lot of bad effects.  Whether cigarette smoking should be banned completely or not become an object of controversy in many countries.  Some people think that smoking is a helpful measure to reduce the stress.  In my view of point, tobacco smoking has seriously negative effects like having smoking-related diseases costing a large amount of money, so it should be banned completely.  First – firstly one of the most harmful impacts of smoking is to damage the health of both smokers and non-smokers.  Smokers are daily taking smoke – smoke into their body, large amount of toxic like nicotine, carbon – carbon monoxide, ammonia, and so on.  If those people persist in smoking then sooner or later – and are in some way or the other be affected by smoking...
Smoking should be banned in restaurants because at public places like in restaurants and other public places, it causes many problems, because in a restaurant, smoke can harm both the customers and employees.  Moreover, smoking is an individual choice so smoker should not engage other people in their own decision because smoking – in a restaurant smoke can harm a child and woman – woman and the customer and employees so smoke – often in adults but there is a bigger problem of smoke is that – that is many health problems like lung cancer, asthma or and – even heart – heart problems, so I think smoking must ban in restaurants and other public places and because – that smoking very harmful for other persons...
Smoking in a restaurant is a very harmful for human being.  It affects on the health of person who are at this – at this time at that place.  Smoking is harmful for a person who uses it but it also proves harmful for others who are at that – at there, eating their food.  Smoking is not considered as a good – a good habit at any cost in our society.  It is totally wastage of money and energy as well and the smokers which is – the smoking which is put on cigarettes is harmful on other human being around the smokers.  A person who used to smoke spends his specific amount in buying those products.  Smoking has a direct attack on mind and liver.  A person who used to smoke, he has gradually lose his health.  He doesn't remain an active person.
By smoking, we usually mean smoking of tobacco, but there are many people who are addicted to the smoking of the afeem and other drugs also.  Now, smoking is one of the most popular habit.  Even women have got this habit.  The habit of smoking prevailed in every part of the world.  Doctors of the world have expressed their opinion about its bad effects and – but the fashion continue.

There are two type of smoking; active smoking and passive smoking.  Smoking is common in young generation.  The start in their colleges and schools.

Smoking should be banned in restaurant.  Restaurant is public place where people come from every society.  Many non-smoker – non-smoker like me against the smoking in public place like bars, restaurants, and park.  I totally agree, it should be banned.  The biggest – the biggest mistake is that a smoker think smoking is harms for only his life when they smoke but smoking harms for everybody who are near the smoker.  A restaurant where people come with their family, their children for enjoy the – enjoyable time but they bad – but the smoking bad smell and smoke spoil your good time and enjoyable time, so that's why it should be banned.  Sometimes, I think how interesting – sometime I think how interesting you go the restaurant and give ordered to fresh water to waiter for fresh...
Smoking is one of the type of death.  A person who accustomed of it, if he or she doesn't take it in a day for once, life becomes hell for them.  In start, smoker take it as a fashion, but gradually they get used to it.  Smoking has become trend among the students.  It is like a virus, spreading and affecting the whole world.  It is not only harmful for smoker but also for their family.  When a child look at their elders who are smoking, they get inspired and they start copying them.  It is not only harmful for health but also effect our morality.  Many diseases occur due to it like lungs, tongue cancer, skin tumor, asthma.  It is a common in all whether they are poor or rich, no matter.  They spoil a large amount of money from their income.  Even their family are starved; they don't care for it.
One of the biggest problem of human lifestyle was smoking and still this problem exists; very harmful and destructive for people's health.  Many non-smokers against smoking in public places like restaurant and then hotel and I totally agree.  The biggest mistake is that people think that they harm themselves when they smoke, but smoke harms everybody who are near the smoker.  Many people visit places with their family, children and want to spend there a good time but that smoke spoils their good evening at the restaurant that is why smoking in restaurant must be banned.  I also must – I also agree that smokers spoil the air with nasty smell and food which is served there – people – spoil the air.  Smoking affects brain, DNA, blood, heart, hormones, and stomach and immune system, all parts – parts of the body.  Smoking around children increase their risk of serious infection and effects...
I am agree with that smoking is banned in restaurants and public places because smoking is a bad habit.  It's a threat among teenagers then the teenagers look the peoples smoking in public areas.  They fas – fascinates and they want to smoke, that's why it is good to banned smoking in public and public areas and the students – I am agree with that but it is not fully banned in our country – in our country, the factories of who – who make cigarettes and narcotics, they are very much interested to spread – to spread all the...
Well, I am totally agree that these people who said that it should be totally prohibited and banned in the country and in the restaurant because there are no advantages of this smoking.  If smoking have advantages it is at individual level but the harm and damages are at social level.  In the restaurant or places, there people come to enjoy these at public places so no one has right to pollute these places and giving their self-mental satisfaction – this for their satisfaction they cannot exploit or spoil the whole environment.  You know in the restaurant, children came with their family, so they get – they get impact and image from other that it is not a good thing to smoke so they don't get a bad image of their nation and their country.  So smoking is not good because it is injurious to health.  There is no advantages of...
Yes, smoking should be banned in the most of places in the country because – because it harms the people who smoke that.  The – the other thing, it harms also the people who are – who – who live around the people who smoke.  It – it cause very – it cause very harm to the people who – even who are nearer to the people who smoke.  Some people have – have money problems of it and some – some people have the cancer – the cancer because of the smoking and the other people they – they also damage their – their liver and they – they also have lungs problem and it should – it should be banned.
Yes, smoking should be banned at all – in all restaurants.  It affects our health badly and it is very injurious – injurious to our health.  As far as I know, it causes the cancer of mouth and many other symptoms like lung cancer.  It doesn't only affect the people during smoking but also the people around them.  Imagine a restaurant; people are having meal and a person is smoking near them, what would be the impact on them?  Like the other people doesn't smoke then obviously he will be disturbed by his smoke and smell of smoking, and also smoking is dangerous for lungs.  As we breathe it come with air to our lungs and damage them.  Because of one smoker, the whole restaurant would get disturbed.  The meal wouldn't taste good to them.  Also, those who are not having this habit will be...
But smoking should be banned in public places because of the especially the smoke – the person who is smoking definitely it is dangerous for that person but the people around that person also get more damage than the – than the smoker and especially in public places, it doesn't look good because if the person is presenting himself or herself or even she is with her family and even it doesn't create good thing for the others, for the peers and it is also not good for the environment for himself also.  And it doesn't look good and it – and also damage the environment, the plant, and even the – the patient could be near him or his – if he is standing or even sitting in the public place, he – there's manners and should...
Yes, basically I'm disagree with that the smoking should be banned because some youngsters which have 12 or 13 years old may be victim of – victim of such these things and this is abusive for some children to take money for their own personal things, but they spend on this smoking, because basically it is bad for the children health and also for the parents to apologizes and the – basically they cannot realize that the students – children have their own personal expenses but when they take money from their parents and expense on their other things then they do not pay attention on these things and stu – teachers may be – teachers may be responsible for these things...
Yes, it's a great idea to ban it in restaurant because smokes travels and it forces the other customer to taste and smell the smoke.  When they would rather be tasty, their food is also good to ban it for health reason.  Passive smoking is a real problem.  Well, I personally dislike it because smoking is absolutely disgusting.  Smokers should have their own life and [***].  I think it should be banned because the smoke is very bad for lungs and it all tries to keep in good health.  However, smokers must have a space or room for them.  Nowadays, smoking is a popular bad habit of our humanity.  Everywhere we can see advertising, which says that smoking destroy your health but nobody pay attention in such inscription.  Consequently, there are many public places where people can eat, talk to and smoke to find...
Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the – our country because if you see a person – person always have simple principle that is highly value that person's lives are highly valued but smoking [***] of the smokers but also to those who breath cigarette smoke in.  People who – who go in the restaurant to eat and even to talk to their friend, I fear the non-smokers when they sit in the smoke – smoking environment, they get illness, disease in the smoke of the cigarette, and this is also the harmful for the passive smokers.  Also, they are not the active smokers and they do not like to smoke...
Well, I think that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants in the country because smoking is a thing which directly affects your lungs and your whole body.  It does  --  does not affect your body but the persons who are sitting around the smoker, they are also affected because the smoke which is arose from the smoking is the persons who are sitting  --  who are sitting around the people, they are also inhaling that smoke, and that smoke will usually affect the lungs, and if the lungs are affected that means the person will soon be dead and that person cannot do anything, and that's why I say that this should be banned in all the restaurants.
I agree with this statement because it is bad for environment and for person.  Smoke goes in air and causes air pollution also.  Smoking is increasing the risk of global warming and diseases in people.  For example, people who smoke are suffering from different diseases such as lung cancer.  For example, a healthy lung is pinkish in color but smoker's lung is dark and unable to have him to breathe properly.  It also causes stroke and heart attack and so it should be banned in all the restaurant because there are different kind of people in restaurants having different disease and different problems and people who have  --  especially people who have asthma can be harmed or even killed if someone is smoking near to them.
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  I think people should not smoke in restaurant because everyone know that smoking is bad thing and prohibited in all areas all over the world, because it causes different diseases and in the restaurant, you know, we eat meal and if someone is trying to eat a meal then it's – I think it's inappropriate to smoke and people who don't like smoking or we can call like non-smokers, they – they should think – we should think about them and as it's not good for health, so we should think about the other people that – about the health of other people because nowadays smoking is becoming very common, so people go and smoke anywhere, someone – some people don't agree that smoking should be banned in the restaurants but they should consider the health of others...
Yes, smoking should be banned in public restaurants.  We all know it's a bad and useless habit.  Many people who go in restaurants are allergic to smoking.  Some people go there with families, especially with children who are more likely to be sensitive to such things.  Besides this, we also hear about fire incidents in many buildings only due to smoking, and it's also feels inappropriate while you are trying to eat non-smokers are passive smokers, inhale smoke, which is a health risk.  Apart from all these things, restaurant owner and the government should make policies in which such bad things are prohibited in our – they should be prohibited.  The environmental protection agency states the – estimates that to live with the smoker increase your chances of lung cancer by 90% – 19%, and as we all know, smoking is a danger for health, so it should be banned not just for restaurants...
Smoking in public places especially in restaurants should be banned because the discharge should not affect the health of others who want to live in smoke-free environment or in healthy environment because it badly affects the meal of others – other people.  Secondly, the smoke is really injurious for those who smoke and also for those who live around him because the smoke contains chemicals that causes cancer and it can also trigger the asthma that is really dangerous.  Nowadays, wherever you go, you may see the people smoking in market and buses and on roads, in restaurants and this habit should be changed because it's very bad influence on children, and we can save the children and even next generation that stop smoking and don't make them breathe injurious smoke.  So people themselves need to avoid smoking in public places rather than government restrict...
Everybody knows smoking is a popular habit of humanity.  Everywhere we can see advertisement which says that smoking destroys your health but nobody pay attention on such instructions.  There are many public places where people can eat, talk to and smoke.  In my mind, every smoker should think about surrounding him people.  Today, we can see that where it is smoking in restaurant, there are alcohol in it.  Every manager take in mind for according to the other people.  It should be the option of the owner to decide.  Obviously, smoking is banned in supermarkets and most government which  --  which I believe is right.  To me, it is very simple.  People should be given the freedom to do anything.  There is a consequence only to themselves.  Smoking directly -- 
Smoking in restaurant should be banned because in the restaurant where food badly affect because of the germs of smoking, and we all are age of – age of people – aged people are – are usually present and smoking is harmful for everyone.  Some of them are patient of asthma who badly affect with it.  Cancer cause – it also cause of cancer.  It – it also cause of different dangerous diseases.  Smokers – it not affect only smokers but also with the surrounding – around the people in which the children, young – young women – and young women and others – others are also affected badly.  From – smoking is very badly for pregnant women for the – for – for the – to in the – in their delivery process, so smoking is very harmful in the – in the restaurant, in the...
Well, I think that the manager, when he makes a project of his future restaurant or current restaurant if he is running, he should not only think about the quality of the food or the cozy condition or the luxurious you know settings but he should also focus on the impression of his place.  The most important thing is that he should take care of the health, you know, health of the customers.  When a smoker smokes, he does not – he doesn't only damages himself from inside but the people around and when you talk about restaurant, they are like family, families are there and kids are there, so it's really dangerous, and yes it should be banned.  I think this reason is enough that it causes cancer to the person – lung cancer to the person and many other diseases who – who is smoking and – and the people around.  Being a Female, when I see a smoker and when I – when I have my aunts and aunties beside me who are pregnant and it – it really makes me, you know, suffocate...
Yeah, I think so.  Smoking in restaurant it should be prohibited permanently because different person have his or her own personality.  Some people don't like the smell of smoke because it is felt [***].  Restaurants are open place for everyone.  Different people use it.  There is a – it's a – it's a – people visit different restaurants for their family entertainment.  Due to the smoking of some person, many people will be suffer, many people will be suffer, and it will effect on – also the rating of a restaurant, different people want to eat at the restaurant.  If there will – there will be many persons who smoke there, people will in fact looking – they felt – feel anxiety so they don't want to go into restaurants.  It will effect the rating of a restaurant and it – and also it is responsibility of the management.  They should control the situation and they should restrict it...

We can see that every person smoke and they – smoking can destroy the health of those people who smoke and like to smoke, and because of smoking, our – our area, our – our new generation and our environment is going to pollute, and especially in some restaurant should be banned because in restaurant every type of member join the restaurant for – for enjoyment and if somebody smoke there and somebody who sit for – to – to enjoy their meal and if somebody smoke there, they should be disturbed because of the smoke – of the smoking and it dangerous for those guy who are smoking and those guy who are already taking the breath – taking up on this environment where the – where the smoking is going on because the...

Smoking should be banned, if it disturbs the environment.  As we all knew the smoking is injurious to health, it's because many various diseases.  It does create suffocation in the environment.  It disturbs the people around when we inhale the smoke.  It may cause different type diseases.  When people in restaurants smoke, they disturb other people around.  Restaurant is not a place for smoke rather it's a place for lunch and peace.  Smoking disturbs other people's peace in restaurant.  Smoking doesn't give a good impact of one's personality.  A smoker not only puts himself in the disease but also it creates the problem for others.  Smoking shows the negative effects of one's personality.  Smoking is kind of fascinating thing.  It may attract some people because they when...

They should be banned in such like public places.  All the smokers should be banned in all public places.  They must be having some rehabilitation activities or techniques...
Yes, I agree to the statement that smoking should be banned at restaurant.  It is the public place, family place, a place of relaxation and refreshment.  People go there to refresh, to relax their mind and their – because it could be a café or a coffee shop, restaurant, food shop and people go there – there for food to relax and but in the same way smoking can cause harmful diseases, and it can also damage the food, the food quality, people will feel uncomfortable.  And it is against ethics and morals and the same way, people should keep in mind all the – all these things and the many people have many breathing problems and disease like asthma and then it also will be very harmful for those and everyone should be careful about all these things and it should be strictly banned in...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned because when a person smokes, he inhales or she inhales into her lungs but then it is definitely dangerous to him or her but the thing is that when you smoke, the other person expose to the smoke as well so it is quite dangerous for everyone who not – who is – who don't smoke, but when a person smokes, it is quite dangerous for himself as well, but we shouldn't do that in publically because all the persons who don't smoke will feel quite irritated or it – because it is very injurious to health.

Continue.  I'm agree with this statement.  Smoking cause – cause air pollution in the environment.  It's – it is the cause of pollution.  It is damaging the environment of public place.  Actually, restaurants are the public place where people – different people use to come and – for recreation.  Smoking is – is not suitable for some people.  They may be allergic of smoking so it can – it can damage their – it can be damage their environment, and it is not good for their health.  They can face severe problem due to the smoking, so it should be banned all over the country and inside the hotels and restaurants.  There should be a separate place for them in restaurants where they can...
Smoking must be banned in all restaurants and bars even.  Nowadays, smoking is the popular bad habit of hum  --  humanity.  Everywhere, we can see advertisements, which said bad smoking destroy our health but nobody pay attention in such inscription.  Consequently, there are many public places where people can eat, talk to, and smoke.  To my mind, every smoker should think about surrounding and people.  First of all, smoking hurts to them.  I think that the manager when he makes project of his future restaurant should not only about visitors satisfaction from food or because conditions, their relaxation and impression from his place.  The most important thing is that he should take care of their health.  He should not allow them to smoke in a hall where there are a lot of non-smokers, even if there is a -- 
Okay.  I will talk about the topic that smoking should be banned from the restaurant, and I agree that smoking should be banned from restaurants because it's very injurious to health and if the places like – public places like restaurants have allow the smoking, that's really harmful to the other people who are sitting around and you are just smoking.  Smoking is dangerous.  It should be actually banned from the whole country and the system if you try because that's not something that gives you good thing or benefits.  That's really injurious for [***] ban it all over the country, you know, I think all over the world someday, and some restaurants have just partitions for smokers and non-smokers section.  They have made it that way but they should not have – allow smoking in the restaurants because it's harmful, even more harmful for the people around you smoke so it should be banned.
Well, according to me, smoking should definitely be banned in public places.  The places they do allow smoking might lose a bit of money but – but it will also help with the health problems that occur.  Most of the people believe that someone who is not in the smoking area in public place will not be affected by the smoke but smoke is able to spread in the room and affect the people around.  Smoking causes a lot of problems not only for the smokers but for the people around.  If some – if someone were – if someone were to put together a protest for those to stop smoking in public, I bet that every non-smoker would say they should.  Well on – well, on the other hand, smoking is up to the individual not others.  If people don't like smoker why the people who are smoking?  Simply – simply, I will not say that smoking should be banned but I do not – but I do not think it is necessary that people should go as...
Oh yes.  Smoking is – is dangerous for health issue.  It should be banned in restaurant.  There should be a policy by owner of restaurant or a hotel so that everyone should, you know, follow that – everyone should follow that, otherwise, they'll be punished by government.  Our government aim to protect us and save us from the society's evil but as there is also a system of bad things and according to – and according to – and according to abusing this policy, people should be badly punished but this may cause unnecessary governmental interference in public places.  So I think so they should be banned on – so, I think the smoking should be banned in restaurant and in public places.  According to – and there's an existence of bad things – also should existence of bad things.
I think smoke – your – I agree with your statement.  Smoking should be banned at all places.  In the way the smoking is dangerous not only for the smokers but also for the people around them.  Smoking is a very bad and mostly common habit in human life.  It has bad impact, affects on human life.  I think it should be banned.  There should be smoking zone for smokers.  If they want to smoke, they have a separate – separate room for their smoking.  Smoking is the right of smoker so government – government should provide them a separate smoking zone for smokers.

When people around inhale it smokes, it may cause different serious diseases like asthma and lung cancer.  Smoking can disturb the environment.  It should be banned in restaurants because restaurants are not specifically make for smoking, so as smoking is dangerous for health, it disturbs people around, so it – it should be prohibited in restaurant so that we should – we should avoid to smoke...

Of course, if you – smoking is something very injurious to health.  Is there something really enjoying it, him or herself?  So if – and it's about being agree or disagree.  Yes, I – you know, I agree with the statement that it should be banned in the restaurant because, of course, if you are smoking it's your business, it's your life, though you are damaging [***], but the people who are sitting around you, they do have a life.  They don't – they don't choose to smoke, then what's their fault that you are making them inhale that – bring this smoke and all that, because the research says that people who are joining smokers they are more – more in risk around instead of the people who are smoking themselves, so it's – it's very dangerous for the people around in the environment.  If you are allowing it in the restaurant, the people where they come to eat and they – they can spend their family time and that kind of thing is really...
And, the restaurant are some places where people come for entertainment, for eating something and they must have the, uh, healthy environment.  Smoking is something that is everybody knows injurious to health.  And, uh, by smoking in that air we get the polluted smoke and which is, um, uh, dangerous for health.  It is not useful at all.  There are no benefits of smoking.  And, it has become, you know, like a fashion people use it.  But, it should be banned and completely prohibited in the country and in the, uh – and there will be, uh, some efforts or movement in all over the world to control this, uh, smoking because there, uh, are no advantages rather they are causing, um, uh, harms for the people.  And, uh, if you know, uh, people smoke and – and, uh, the people who come in the...
Um.  Smoking, uh, is not – as we know that the smoking not only affect the smoker's health but it also affect the health of others that are around the smokers.  And, uh, it – I think it should be banned in the country because of the smokers and the smoking and, uh, all the, hmm, commercial things of the smoking.  And, their banners, children are, uh, getting sucked by, uh, the – by the smoking.  And, uh, they are getting – children are also affecting by them and the, uh, uh – smokers are ignoring the health of the adults.  Because if they are smoking at the public places there may be the effect on the other people because, uh, uh, they do not aware that there may be, uh, someone who is physically, uh – who is physically weak and, uh, he get affect by the cigarette.  And, it should be banned because, um, um – by banning the smoker or by the cigarette we can, uh, maintain the health of the country and also the economical state.  And, uh...
Yeah, I strongly, uh, agree, uh, that, uh, smoking should be banned in all countries, uh, in – in – in the restaurants.  Uh, smoking is a very bad habit actually and it caused ourselves in various way.  Uh.  We can see, um, advertisement or, uh, on TV about smoking destroying your health but, uh, we – we cannot, uh, focus on it and we – no – nobody paid attention on this.  Actually, when we talk about smoking, uh, smoking ban in restaurant or not, uh, it is, uh, it is very, uh, you know, obvious that, uh, smoking should be banned because these are the public places.  And, uh, public, uh, places and, uh, every smoker, uh, should, uh, think about the surrounding and the people around him.  Because smoking also hurts to them, and the restaurant is for visitor and, uh, visitors' relaxation and their enjoyment.  But, the important thing is that the manager should know about it...
Smoking should be banned on all public places.  If we talk specifically about the prohibition in restaurants then I would, uh, surely be in favor of it.  It should be banned in all restaurants because not only smokers visit that places but other people also spend time there.  Sometimes they are having their meals, are having lunch and dinner and all kind of things.  Well, doing so they breathe and when they breathe the smoke in the environment of the restaurant affects their lungs.  The smokers smoke for their desires and need of their body but they unknowingly and unwillingly affect the health of others.  It should be banned because in majority of people, uh – the majority of people are non smokers.  But despite of these, um, this they have to suffer – they have to suffer because of...
It is very well known fact that, you know, people die every year from lung cancer as a result of smoking.  So, many countries prohibit smoking in public places.  Uh.  In the hotel situation, smoking – a policy would be set by the board and restaurants owners.  There should be separate smoking zones for smokers and nonsmokers that could be sectioned and referenced for smokers and nonsmokers.  To my mind, smoking in public places especially in the restaurants and cafes must be banned.  In my opinion, we have to prohibit, uh, of the advertisement of tobacco in mass media.  And, there should be a separate smoking zone for smokers and nonsmokers.  And, uh, it, uh, smoke, uh, affects the yield and also destroys the food which is served, uh, because, uh – and it – it also caused, uh, the health problems.  And, uh, it creates already disturbance for those people who are, uh – who don't like, uh, the – who don't like to do the smoking.  And, I think smokers, uh, think that it just – it's just all, uh, uh – it just harmed their – themselves.
Yeah, of course, I must be, uh, I must be, uh, you know, uh, agreed that, uh, smoking must be banned, uh, in all restaurants and public places.  Uh, nowadays smoking is a popular bad habit of humanity.  Everywhere we can see advertisement which said that smoking destroy your health but nobody pay attention in such inscriptions.  Consequently, there are many public places where people can eat, talk, and to – and smoke.  To my mind, uh, um, every smoker should think about surrounding him people first of all smoking hurt to them.  Think that manager when he makes project of his future restaurant should think not only about visitors' satisfaction from food or cozy, uh, conditions, their relaxation and impression from his place.  The most important thing is that he should take care of their health.  He should not allow them to smoke in a hall where there are a lot of nonsmokers.  Even, if there is a special separate hall for them, manager should take a responsibility and think just for...
According to my opinion, uh, yes, uh, smoking must be banned at restaurants as restaurants are places for eating but not for smoking.  The place that, uh – for – that, uh, that is for eating that must be kept, uh, in high hygienic, uh – in high hygienic environment.  But, the – they must – they must not be polluted in anyway.  So, with smoke and fumes the environment becomes suffocating and uncomfortable.  And, at such places there are families, um, uh, uh, along with them are kids, uh, which are – which can be affected badly with the smoke.  People should care for others who do not smoke as smoking can cause various diseases to those not only, uh, um – to those not only who smoke but also to those who don't smoke – and, uh, but used to be in a smoke environment.  So, people who smoke they should, um...
This is the matter of how you deal the matter.  This is – this basically depends upon the points of view of different people.  If you ask a smoker to prohibit, uh, smoking in all the restaurants then he would surely say no.  He would say smoking is as necessary as water for life.  But if you ask someone who doesn't like to smoke and you ask him whether smoking should be prohibited in all the restaurants he would argue – he – he would obviously be saying yes because he doesn't like smoking.  The smoke of the cigarettes, uh – the smoke of the cigarette disturbs him mentally, physically, and even some people get disturbed, uh, get suff – suff – got suffocated through this kind of smoking.  So they won't, uh, they won't like the, uh – they won't like to get smoking in all the restaurants.  They would like to be free of smoking.  They would like to enjoy their meals.  They would like to eat the dishes...
So, I think that smoking should be banned in the, uh, the restaurants and the public places as well all around the world.  Because, uh, what I think, uh, biggest misconception of the smoker is that, uh, they think they harm only themselves, uh, when they smoke.  But, in actual, smoke harms everybody who is near the smoker.  Most of the people, uh, will be in the restaurant when they want to enjoy with their family, children.  They want to spend there a good time but the nasty and irritating smell of the smoke – of the smoke spoils your, uh, good evening and makes you upset.  That's why it must be banned.  But on the other hand, uh, smokers also have their rights.  So, uh, they also want to have a good time with their friends at restaurants by talking on any topic, uh, while smoking.  Uh.  Smokers say that cigarettes are good to feel relaxed.  Many people have very intense, stressful jobs so they want to have a cigarette.  But, uh, especially to the problem of smoking in public places, uh...
Smoking is not good for health but smoking is very popular bad habit of humanity.  We can see that the smoking can destroy our health but nobody can feel this.  And – we – and we can use in many, uh – in many restaurants many people are eat and meal and, uh, and after that they are about – they are, uh, this – they start smoking.  We – and we think about the people if we can – if we can think about other people.  If the smoking is – if smoking is banned in restaurant in this – in – in this, uh – people who, uh – people...
Smoking is, uh, injurious to health.  Smoking should be banned in, uh, all the restaurants because I am totally agree with you because smoking is very injurious to health.  And, restaurants is a place where the family comes, the family, and family members and friends come together for dinner, lunch, or breakfast and enjoying the evening or, uh, uh, their – like their – the time – and enjoying time and have fun and eating together in the place.  And, no smoking should be there.  No man – no person who smokes should be allowed to sit in the restaurant with the family members or the families because cigarette smoking at the food place is, uh, not allowed.  It – it – it is – it give a bad impact to their, uh, viewers, to their watchers and to viewers and that food – where we get food is very good for health.  If we are eating something and, uh, there is someone who is smoking...
Smoking should be banned in the restaurants because a person who smokes, uh, he feels good but the person who is sitting around is, uh, feels some irritation by the smoke of the cigarette.  It also causes some disease in the person who are sitting around.  Smoking in a public place is – must be banned.  Smoking is not bad but, uh, doing it in a public place is bad.  People should avoid from doing the smoking in the restaurants because the people who are sitting around us, uh, dislike this activity.  That's why smoking must be banned, uh, in the restaurants.  Smoke, uh, we should not smoke in the open – we should smoke in a particular place.  Uh, the – the restaurant management should make a proper place for the smokers to sit there and smoke for a particular time.  Uh, the restaurant smoking must be banned because the children and the other families are sitting around us and they feel irritation by the smoke, uh, arising from the cigarette.  It's a bad habit, uh, to smoke in the society.  Uh.  We, uh...
According to me – me smoking should be banned from all the places around this world because smoking is very injurious to health.  It can destroy your lungs.  There are a lot of chances that you have lung cancer.  And, if you have lung cancer that's very dangerous for you, your life is in danger.  You will surely die within a year.  If you – smoking is very injurious to your health.  It's all around the smoke, uh – the smoke coming out from your cigarette or smoking of any kind – and are injurious to other person as well around you.  You should, uh – you shouldn't leave – you should leave this – you should leave this smoking because it – it can destroy your health.  It is also – it is also dangerous for your family.  If you are a smoker then there are a lot of chances that if you – if you have any disease your family will be in trouble.  There are a lot of money you will spend on your disease, lung cancer.  Now there is a very...
Uh.  But, it should be not banned at all.  It's up to you whether a person is addicted of smoking and, uh, he may not found – he found pleasure in smoking and he gets rid of when he does not, uh – when he needs smoke, uh – when he needs smoking and he not gets.  So, it should not be banned at all because it's up to a person rather what temperament he is having.  He is feeling, uh, giddy-giddy, dizzy-dizzy when he is not getting the – the proper amount of nico – nicotine.  And, he gets bored and nothing is pleasurable to him.  So, when he smokes it gives pleasure to him.  So, it – it is, uh, not banned at all.  So, I don't think so it is banned.  So, it is, uh – it is banned for him as – as he – he wants to smoke so nobody have right to stop him because it is the right of individual to, uh...
According to, uh – according to my point of view I think needs for – I think smoking should be banned in all the restaurants.  And, for, uh, restaurants one who is, uh, smoking got the pleasure but the rest of the people sitting around become suffocate.  Women and children sitting in the restaurant become fed up.  Some people, uh – some people are allergic – allergic to smoke.  That's why a smoker should not smoke in the public place.  I think, uh, smoking, uh, should be banned.  I think it should be banned in all restaurants.  And, uh, smoke – smoking is not a good habit either, uh, but, uh, some people – some high, uh, class families and so, uh, high class...
Smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  I wonder whether this statement is only confined to restaurants?  I am suggesting that it should be banned at all the workplaces, at all the public places and in this scientific era, we know very well that what are the harmful effects of smoking, so why should we allow it at places like restaurant or any other place because we all know that smoking is detrimental for health, smoking is harmful for health.  It is not good for the human being.  It is a source of causing lungs cancer.  In the places like restaurant it's – they are the places where public comes for the sake of enjoyment, for the sake of having tea, for the sake of having fun, for the purpose of taking a...
Actually, uh, smoking is, uh – altogether it's not good, uh, because it, uh, affects your health badly and, uh, because, uh, at restaurant there are so many people.  Then, by, uh, the smoke of, uh – uh, um, uh, by the smoke of cigarette, uh, uh, they can affect, uh, very badly.  And, uh, it can, uh – it can cause, uh, diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, and all other major disease, uh, can be, uh, there in their bodies.  Uh.  Only when families, you know, go there in restaurants and there are children as well the most, uh, terrible, uh, thing for our country.  Uh.  So, uh, but, uh – they are, uh, getting, uh – if they are inhaling the smoke, uh, uh, it will, uh, affect them badly.  It can, uh...
Smoking is not – I think smoking should be banned in country at open places because it affects our brain and lungs in such a way that they are not in a proper condition to work in a better way and more than all things, smoking is banned in our religion and the – if people openly smoke at public places so it will – it will create a – a – a trend in youngsters to smoke again and again and it's a bad thing.  So it should be banned.  When a smoker used to smoking, his nerves and – his nerves and lungs are affected in such a way that he is completely – smoking is completely injurious to health when a – when a person becomes completely addicted to smoking and he can't find some of the materials; cigarettes, etcetera, so he himself...
Now, the topic is about smoking at public places.  First of all, I am completely disagree that smoking should be banned all over the world because every country should – should ban smoking in public places ban because it is really awkward and irritating activity for the people because people have different attitudes and responses towards smoking.  They may don't like the person who is smoking in front of them, so I think in restaurants there must be a special side area for such chain smokers where they are freely – are freely allowed to smoke so that the people around them may not irritate and they are – and they feel calm and – then it – it don't looks awkward.
Yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned all the places in the country and because it is harmful not only for the smoker but also for the people who breathe in the toxic air and there are several advertisement that show that – that smoking destroys your health but the smokers do not pay any attention in such inscription and they do smoke either in – even in the public places.  And I think that every smoker should think about himself first and also about the people surrounding him as well.  Of course, people who smoke or – it may cause several diseases not just for them but also diseases for the others like it should be banned in all...
In this age, smoking has become very important topic for discussion.  It is very dangerous for – for young people.  It has bad effect on the health of people who addicts the smoking as it cause the destruction of people energy.  Because of smoking, people pay to many – many horrible diseases like lungs – lungs, liver, etcetera, but who people are firstly used this for enjoyment but later they addict and become an enemy of their life.  They cannot – they – they cannot resist this – this smoking action because the level of smoking is mostly destroyed energy level of young and then they cannot pay...
Yes, I agree with you that smoking should be banned in Pakistan because smoking has too much bad effects on the health of people, mainly male and also female equally.  It causes bad effects on the lungs due to which alveoli the substance present inside the lung destroyed.  Here destruction causes a large air spaces present between the lungs due to which no one can take breathing properly due to which our blood circulation also affected and the protein which carry oxygen in the blood also affects.  Due to all these reasons, smoking is – should be banned in Pakistan also – but I think so also in the whole world, it should be banned.  It – it affects the – the diseases due to smoking are emphysema, due to emphysema, the alveoli are destroyed.  The destruction of alveoli is badly...

Yes, smoking should be banned at all types of restaurants in any country because it will create a very harmful effect for the other persons who mostly came to the restaurant just for the recreation activities and the food activities.  The person like to eat food mostly on the places which are clean and clean and those places that not polluted at all but the smoking – smoking pollutes the area and the environment to a greater extent.  It creates a very harmful effect for the health of the persons who are doing smoking and who are related to that places as well, so I think smoking should be banned strictly on all the restaurants and it should not be allowed not only by the waiters, not only by the restaurant persons but also by the persons who come just for eating activity and...
Yes, I am agree that smoking should completely be out from the restaurant, different room, seminars and conferences because it is really harmful for the health.  It creates a – a lot of health problem for our society, for our children, youth and it's really destroying our youth.  When here as you mention that smoking is not allowed in the – in different places and it will definitely create a very good situation, a very good atmosphere for the people in different places, in different events and they will really get relief from this because smoking cau – has a lot of problems.  Smoking create a lot of diseases and it's really very – it's really create a very bad atmosphere.  Some people feel suffocation during the smoking.  Whenever a person...
[***] it creates cancer and so many diseases like cancer, mouth cancer and lungs problems.  Smoking is very injurious to health.  It also pollute – pollute our environment and increases the litter in the environment, the evidence is there, littering attractive buildings and the surrounding and place and cigarette butts and it is still a credible one.  No one should smoke to reduce the litter, to have the – have the – it is not good for health and especially with the – for the children.  Nowadays, many of us smoke and it – it may – it – it has become a habit – a habit but they don't know at that...
Smoking is injurious to health.  In my opinion, it is good but many countries and many policy are being made on the banning of smoking for all over the – all over the country because it can lead to many different diseases.  It can cause liver cancer.  It can cause throat cancer.  It can cause different diseases to our respiratory system.  It – and plus youngsters feel very confident in this.  They think it is a very – they look very cool after using – after smoking but in reality, this is not the case, but smoking is seriously very damaging for the human body and it is also the uncooked factor in any one's persona.  I think smoking is something...
Smoking is very dangerous for health.  It is the basic cause of lung cancer.  It also affects the throat and breath system.  The habit of smoking is very rare in every part of the world.  Even women have caught up this habit.  Smoking is very dangerous for smoker.  It's also – the smell of smoking is also effect the other people.  Many people allergic from the smell of cigarettes.  Therefore, it's a bad habit and dangerous for health.  Smoking is very dangerous for the young generation.  Many young people – boys, start smoking to see the other boys.  Smoking gets on in different countries.  Even poor countries...
Hi there!  This is XXX.  I am a student of doctor of physical therapy.  Everyone knows and sees smoking is injurious to health, but some – some of our youngsters and other people don’t follow it.  People smoke at public places, restaurants, and also in universities.  Smoking is not only dangerous for smoker, but its smoke also affects the nonsmoker.  It's the - it's also the main reason for lungs cancer.  In Islam, smoking is also prohibited, but the smokers are addicted to smoking.  When they smoke in public places, it also gets the ethical values but they don’t bother it.  Smoking should be completely banned in public places and smokers should be fined strictly for smoking in public places.    
Should smoking be banned in public areas such as restaurants and airport terminals?  Well, in my point of view, smoking should be banned in public areas.  Why should smoking be banned?  We are not limited - limiting the freedom of the persons who smoke.  However, this is because smoking in public areas will be disturbance to the people around the smokers and it will shorten the lives of the smokers.  By restricting some of – some of the people in areas not to smoke, lots of people will benefit from that.  Why should smoking be banned in public areas?  There are two reasons for that.  Firstly, it…    
Smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in the country.  More and more countries decide to ban smoking in all public places including restaurants and coffee shop.  Despite of all evidence that smoking causes lungs cancer and other severe conditions, there is still a lot of smoking citizen in our society.  Should the government prohibit of all these people from smoking in public places?  In my opinion, it should certainly do this.  First, my foremost, as we know smoking is - in crowded places is harmful not only to person who carry cigarette, all people standing around the person breathe in containment smoke.  Let's take a bus stop as an example.  There is always lot of people there.    
I strongly disagree with the statement that there should be any feeling of smoking at restaurant.  Restaurants should be kept free from this evil.  Families go to there enjoy, to relax.  They are going there in a peaceful atmosphere and feel comfortable there, and it – and if there is smoking and smoke all around, how can they enjoy and feel at ease in smoke?  The smoke is very dangerous not only for the smoker but – but also for the persons sitting nearby, so it should completely ban.  No person should be allowed to smoke in the premises.  Smoking at restaurant - restaurants should be kept free from this evil.  Families go there to enjoy, to relax their time there in a peaceful atmosphere and feel comfortable there and if there is smoking…    
I totally agreed with the statement that smoking must be banned in all restaurants and other public places because of its composition which mainly consist of nicotine, tobacco.  The smoke of this tobacco is very harmful to our environment causing air pollution and many diseases in human body like ulcer, like cancer, like many problems of throat and trachea.  It can also affect our different systems like respiratory systems, circulatory system, immune system, and may be fatal for all these organs.  High risk – high risk of cancer is the main reason for banning smoking.  In addition, discarding cigarette butts, cigarettes which are used to smoke, can be a big problem.  Cigarette butts constitute the overwhelming majority of litter in the public places such as parks, which is - so we must avoid these.    
Yes, I am strongly in the favor of this issue because at one hand public law doesn’t allows it, and on the other hand, regarding the general etiquettes and manners, it doesn’t look nice to smoke at any public place.  Mostly, there are signs that doesn’t allow smoking in most of the restaurants, but people don’t care for them.  Mostly, people are so addicted and some other use it as a fashion - and some other use it as a fashion so they don’t care wherever they are and wherever they are using it.  Moreover, smoking is injurious to health of not only the smoker but also to those who move around smokers.  So along with these restrictions, people must be made fully aware of the negative effects of the smoking on the health so that not only restaurants but also public places should be safe and smoking should be reduced.    
Yes, smoking should completely ban at every restaurant in the country because smoking is not good for health.  Nowadays, people adopt smoking for fashion, but they don’t think that this fashion is not good for their health.  Smoking is injurious to health.  It cause many disease, especially heart disease.  This habit is increasing among new generation.  Their parents forbid them, but they are not paying any attention.  They go restaurants and smoke.  Smoking should also ban at restaurants might be due to this smoking habit will decrease among people, but they don’t think that smoking cause disease and also cause for death.    
I agree with the statement because restaurants are place where we go to eat and relax.  We go there to have a nice time, we go there to enjoy in a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.  We feel comfortable there and like to sit there and enjoy.  If there is smoking all around where you dine and relax, how can a person relax and feel comfortable in that unhealthy environment?  So, I agree that restaurants should be spared from this evil and smoking should be banned completely there.  We go there to enjoy a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.  We feel comfortable there and – and like to sit there and enjoy.  If there is smoking all around where you dine and relax, how can a person relax and feel comfortable in that unhealthy environment.  So, I agree that restaurants should be spared from this evil and smoking should be banned completely.    
Smoking should be complete ban on all the restaurant -restaurants of the country.  Smoking is very bad for the children of our society and if the young children of our society are interested in smoking, this affect the coming generation also, so that smoking is very bad for all the restaurants of the country.  Our government - our government should ban the smoking and smoking is very bad habit.  Most of the students are interested in smoking like a fashion.  They are smoke because they see in the movies and they - they – they mimic them and they – they are smoking.  In our countries, smoking - in most of the countries, there…    
Smoking is injurious for health.  A person is affected by smoking.  The – the persons do not directly damage them – the persons are not affected actively, but they are also affected passive – but they are also affected passively by smoking.  The persons who are in contact with the smokers are called passive smokers and the smoking affects the health and the pers – other persons do not like the company of a person who smoke.  The person – the – smoking is a really bad habit and it has a hazardous effect on the health, and it is really injurious and smoking is not good for health because it affects the health of the person and smoke – a person who smoke is – does not like...
Okay, the topic is that the smoking should be prohibited in our country, our – in – in world, so I am angry with this topic that smoking should be prohibited in all over the world, because it is not at all useful for our countries, our nations, our world; it is injurious to our health.  It has no usefulness.  There are no advantages of smoking.  On the other hand, there are managers that want to get off this smoking.  It is the wastage of money, wastage of your life and it consumes the 10 years of life if we continuously smoking in our life.  It is bad for the women who smoke and they have some pregnancy problems like this during their pregnancy and the Male who – who smoke, they also have a lot of problem because it cause the – it is the cause of cancer of lungs, cancer of mouth, etcetera.
Tobacco industry is one of the biggest industries in the world.  It occupies a lot of business.  It – so this is the main cause of generating and producing cigarettes.  The lung cancer is one of the idiosyncrasies of the smokers.  Smoking has a very bad impact on the lungs.  It has also bad effect on other parts of the body, for example, mouth, stomach and esophagus, throat, chest, but lungs are the first part of the body that is affected by the smoking.  It reduces – smoking reduces the life of the smokers up to 10 years.  It has a sexually and reproductively bad impact on the person who smokes and in many conditions it – it affects...
I am totally disagree about this topic, smoking.  Smoking at public places should be banned because this has too many disadvantages.  However, bad effect of smoking cannot be relating concerning health issue.  Nicotine is the main source of developing lung cancer, which has become an epidemic to poorer nations.  Passive effect of smoking is also another subject to count.  Medical researches show that a non-smoking person living along with the smoker has a great chance of getting lung cancer too, and this is called passive smoking and overall it would be best if there was no cigarette in the world, then people may find an alternative for cigarette and as a result at least passive smoker would get relief from breathing...
Yes, the smoking should be banned because there is – there are not at all benefits of smoking and all types of workers are in smoking.

Smoking should be banned because it is really bad for health.  It causes cancers and lot of more diseases that come – that make personal – that make a person physically and mentally unhealthy and it causes a lot of diseases that can lead into death.  Cigarette smoking contains chemicals, which irritate the passages and lungs and it causes cough, so a coughing disease can also be caused through smoking.  Smokers are likely to get pneumonia because of damage or destroyed organs and cilia that cannot protect lungs from different germs and tar which is a material or chemical that is present in smoking product, which – which covers inside the intestines and that cause – that causes a lot of pain and – that which is...
Smoking not only effect the health but it also effect on the psyche of a smoker.  A person who used to smoke because curious, he quarrels with family members at – and if anyone trying to advise him that how much smoking is harmful for him and for society, he considers that man his enemy.  The smokers not only destroy their own health but also the persons who are closer to him.  Despite the fact that on the cigarette box, the picture of a person is printed who is suffering from mouth cancer, smokers they did not realize what they are doing.  Actually, it's – I realize that smoking should be banned in the world because smoking is nothing but only the waste of time and wealth.  There are some solutions – some research, which may have been helpful to eradicate this bad habit.  Firstly, there...
We know that most of the people start smoking when they are very upset.  They think that smoking is very big solution of our problem but today our younger generation are ignoring the reports and students think that smoking is good thing.  They think that smoking is part of modern life but after some year then they totally involve in smoking.  At this point, we  --  we think that smoking is very dangerous thing.  I personally believe that we should get more against the smoking.  We know that every one company write on every pack that smoking is cause of cancer and heart problems, and damps our breath, which shows that we are uneducated person because we know.  I think therefore we are involved -- 
As we know that smoking is very much bad to our health and it is a big cause of lung cancer, so we should avoid this smoking and  --  because when we smoke at the places where family used to come, then we actually give right to smoking because when family come, their children are with them and when they see there that others are smoking, they also become curious to that smoking, and the boys who are young start smoking as a fashion and then they become addicted and gradually they start to take  --  they start to take drugs as a fashion and they become drug addicted.

According to statistics from WHO, around 5.4 million death a year are caused by tobacco, which is more cigarettes do not just harm the people with smoke, they also harm the people who are near them and breathe the smoke.  Passive smoking causes them health problems including lung cancer, respiratory illness in healthy non-smoker.  Second-hand smoke is particularly dangerous for pregnant women and their children, and it is necessary to prohibit cigarette smoking actually even in public places and private places.  Another adverse influence of smoking is costing a large number  --  tons of smoke and further to cure smoking related illness.  Smoking seems to be habit even and addict  --  addiction of many people, so they spend a lot of money to satisfy their habit.  The result is that the more they smoke, the more serious diseases they suffer from, sure they have to cost a lot -- 
I think smoke should be banned in restaurants because at public places, it cause many problems, because in restaurant, smoke can hurt both customers and employees and ill smoke often – and smoke often become cause of annoyance so there is a bigger problem of smoke is that health problem like lung cancer, asthma and even heart problem, so I think smoking must be banned in restaurant because in our restaurant there are also from chil – children and pregnant women so that – that's why smoking can harm that – them all so smoking must be banned in restaurants, and we – smoking should – a restaurant smoke – it is an individual choice, so smoker should not engage other people in their own choice.
While talking about smoking in restaurant, I would like to say that the ingredients which – which are used in the process of making or producing smoking products, they are the – they are made with poisonous ingredients and which are the harmful for person who – who – who is smoker.  I think smoking is the first step toward the drug addiction.  This habit – this habit of smoking affects on the health of the users and his family too.  He – a chain smoker can destroy his life and he destroys the life of his – life of his family members too.  A smoker is considered as a morally corrupt person who loses his good reputation by doing so.  Our – it is the – it is responsibility of society and to some extent NGO to stop...
Undoubtedly, smoking invigorates one's nervous system and their physical and mental system also, but smoking are – by smoking we injure our health and it also causes cancer disease and smoking – smokers get bad and dirty teeth which cause other diseases and the bad – bad breath and stinks in the mouth.

Smoking has become very common and especially – especially among young boys.  They start smoking in their colleges to check and give – build a taste, try to understand what is this.  Despite the warning given by doctors about the ill effect of smoking, people continue smoking.  Smoking is bad habit especially in public places.  Two type of smoking, active smoking and passive smoking.  Active smoking is who is smoke and passive smoking is called people around the smokers.  Passive smoking is more harmful than active smoking.  There are over 400 – 4000 chemicals in tambaku smoking and above 60 chemicals in cause of cancer.  If the smoke is complex mixture of chemicals and smoking involve inhaling and absorbing chemical...
Smoking should be banned in restaurant.  Restaurant is public place where people come from every society.  People belong maybe some different culture and different society so it should be banned.  Many non-smoker like me against of smoking in public place like bars, restaurants.  I totally agree it should be banned.  The biggest mistake is that in our society is that a smoker think smoking is harm for this – for this only his life when they smoke, but smoke harms for everybody who are near the smoker.  A restaurant where people come with their family, children for enjoy the time but that bad smell and smoke spoil their – spoil their own time and spoil good time so that's why it should be banned.  Sometimes, I think how interesting when you go the rest...
It is not only harmful for smoker but also for their families.  When a child look at their elders while smoking, they get inspired and start copying them.  It is not only harmful for health but also affects our morality.  Many diseases occur due to like – due to it like lung cancer, skin tumor, asthma.  It is common in all whether they are poor or rich, no matter.  It start from – it is start from Europe as a fashion and it – it become a monster in underdeveloped countries.  I think government should take prompt action to clean up the Pakistan and in fact it should be eliminated from the whole world.  The smoker not only destroy his own health rather it creates danger for their family in spite of the fact that on cigarette box the pic...
One of the biggest problem of human lifestyle are smoking and still this problem exist, very harmful and destructive for people's health.  Many non-smokers against smoking in public places like restaurant and I totally agree.  The big mistake is that people think that they harm themselves when they smoke, but smoke harms everybody who are near the smoker.  Many people visit places with his family, children and want to the only good time but that and smoke spoils their good evening in restaurant that is why smoking in the restaurant must be banned.  I always was – there always must be lawn for smoker so that they don't disturb other people because smokers spoil the ill – air with that nasty smell food which is served there and harm the people's health.  That is why smoking affects brain, head, lungs, heart, hormones, brain, immune system, stomach and other parts of the body.  Smoke – smoking around children increases their risk of serious infection that affect breathing, non...
Smoking is very dangerous for human body but now these days, it became a sign of high status, especially young girls and boys think that if they smoke, then they consider then that they belong to high class.  They do not smoke that only, they use also different flavors like apple and strawberry flavor.  Smoking – smokers have not respect in a society; people don't like them.  The people of the society think that the smokers are morally inde – indecent.  Most of the girls and boys start smoking as fashion but after some time, they are affected very badly, that's why we banned smoking in a public places and in front of young girls and boys.
People you know come at the restaurant to enjoy with the family.  They want to enjoy lunch, dinner, etcetera so no one has any right to spoil their time and harm them by giving smoke through their smoking, so it is not at all good thing to smoke especially in the public places like restaurant because you know when someone is eating something and other person is smoking beside him, how can that person – how then first person can eat satisfactorily?  So he will – by eating he will also getting inside smoke which is very damage and very, very harmful for that person.  What is – why that person should be harm – should be victim of smoke too while he is not smoking at all?  We think smoking is a thing which is harmful for the person who is smoking and for – harmful for also the person who is sitting beside them, so the smokers must be take care...
It is – it's just give harms – smoking just gives harm for – just harm for the people and some people say that it's – they relieve their tension when they smoke or something like that but it is that it is not like that.  It should be banned on – it should be banned on public places and the – the smoking companies who make the cigarettes, they should be banned.  It is only give harmful to the people nothing else.  It's – they – the more – more – most of the people who are in hospital is because of the smoking.  Smoking is the major cause of cancer...
Yes, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants because it affects our health badly, adversely.  It is very injurious to health because it causes the cancer of mouth and lung.  It doesn't only affect the people who are smoking but also greatly affect people who are just around them.  In the restaurant, people are having smoke, people are having a good meal and especially smoking near to them.  What would be the impact on them?  Obviously, the smoke doesn't – would disturb them and the smell of smoking would make the food un-delicious for them, and as we breathe, we know that air comes to our lungs and its – this smoke air damages our lung directly, so because of a smoker, the whole restaurant would get disturbed.  The meal taste wouldn't sound good to me – good to the people.  Also, the people who are not getting it would be impressed by its habit.  They...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because it's also the kind of a big place and the place of food, place of eating and the restaurant, and smoking harm the smoker definitely in the same case but the people sit around him or her will also get more damage than that person and the – so like that.  The restaurant is a place of food, should be cleaned and neat and it should have a neat and clean environment and smoking, it can also cause damage and it also harm the food and cause a lot of diseases so it should be – should be banned.  And it doesn't look also good because people go there – go to the restaurant for relax – to relax and for the refreshment and their smoking and like the smoke – smoking will harm environment and it will not refresh anymore for the – the people...
Smoking should be stopped because at the age of the 12 or the 13, children are addict to the – these things.  They see that things and they want to take this but basically this is good – this is bad for their health and also for their parents.  And it had a bad impact on their society and the children who are victims of these things, they also affect the other – other children which are – which are connected to those children.  And basically this should be banned at the age of at least – at least at the age of 30 – 30 years because after 20 years, they may – their growth may be stopped because smoking is just an element because it has a bad impact on their health and also their parents and basically parents are not responsible for that but the children who are...
To my mind, every smoker should think about surrounding him people.  First of all, smoking hurts to them.  I think that manager when he makes project of his future restaurant, should think not only about visitor satisfaction from – put a cozy condition, their relaxation and impression for – from this – from this place.  The most important thing is that he should take care of health.  He shouldn't allow them to smoke in a hall where there are lot of non-smokers.  Even if there is a special separate hall for them, manager should take a responsibility and think just for a minute that money is not the first aim of his restaurant.  It is that he wants to make people's life more interesting, more various and carry joyful and peace to their life.  Today, we can see that where is – where it is smoking in restaurant, there are alcohol drinks in it.
Smoking is a popular habit of the humanity.  Everywhere we can see the advertisement of – advertisement of the smoking which says that smoking destroys your health; it is dangerous to your health but nobody – nobody pays attention in such implication.  So they always see that advertisement and [***] but is also – it should be banned in the restaurant because – because it is – it is harmful for the – both for the health of the smokers and also for the non-smokers.  Because the non-smoker who came into the – who come into the restaurant and to eat – to eat the meal and to talk with friends and to spend their time very well but when they breathe...
I am saying that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants.  Not even the restaurants but in all the places of the country because the nicotine present in the smoke  --  in the smoke of the cigarette, it directly affects the brain and the brain slows down the working efficiently, and smoking is injurious to health.  We should not smoke because the person who is smoking is not just affecting his own lungs but the person sitting around him, they are also affected by his own  --  by his own smoking so he should think about them that what he is doing and why he is doing, and it also slows down the blood pressure and if the blood pressure is slowed down, that means you are not going to do very well in anything the whole day, and if the whole day is spoiled, that means you are not going to do anything.
I agree with this statement because I think that it should be banned – it should be banned in all restaurants, even in all public – at all public places, and because smoking is bad for environment and for person, for kid also.  Smoke is – smoke goes into the air and hence cause the air pollution and different kind of diseases.  Smoking is increasing risk of global warming also, and people who smoke are suffering from different diseases such as lung cancer and heart – heart attack and stroke, etcetera, so it should be banned all over the restaurants because in restaurant, there are different kind of people having different problems, different diseases, and if some – someone is smoking there and people who have asthma can harm or killed – killed.  If there – there are kids in restaurant and someone is smoking, that it would be too dangerous...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants because they should consider – people should consider the health of the other people.  Some people have many kind of problems, for example, they have lung diseases, they have asthma diseases, and many people are dying due to these diseases, so I think smoker should know when it is appropriate to smoke and when it is not appropriate to smoke or on which places they should – they should smoke or which places they should not smoke because everyone – everyone don't like smoking.  There are some people who likes – who like to smoke but there are also other kind of people who don't like to smoke and due to smoke, they inhale – they inhale the smoke.  I think that this smoke involves the – creates different diseases in human being and very...
As we all know, smoking is dangerous for health so it should be banned not just for restaurant but I think it should be banned in all other public places.  It cause many harmful diseases like lung cancer and other respiratory diseases.  Some people don't feel well when they inhale smoke and they get sick so people should care of other as well as for their own health, and it should be banned in public restaurants as we already know that's a useless and bad habit.  Many people go to restaurants with their families.  They are allergic to smoke and especially the children who are more likely sensitive to such thing.  Besides these, we also hear about fire incidents in many buildings only due to smoking and feel not good while you are trying to eat and the – it disturbs your privacy.  Non-smokers are passive – passive smokers inhale smoke, which is a health...
Smoking in public places especially in restaurants should be banned because it's a smoker's choice and he should be affect but not others who want to live in smoke-free environment or in healthy environment.  It – because it badly affect the meal of other and you know nowadays, wherever you go, you may see people smoking in market, buses or even in – on roads and in the – in restaurants, so this habit should be changed because it's very bad influence on children and we can save our children and our next generation by stop smoking and even don't make them smoking in your – even don't make them breathe in your smoke, so people themselves need to avoid smoking in public places rather than they get restrict – government restriction, so smoking is very injurious for those who smoke and also for those who live around him.  It...
I think it should be the option of the owner to decide.  Obviously, smoking is banned in supermarkets and most environment which I believe is right.  To me it is very simple, people should be given the freedom to do anything that is a consequence only to themselves – themselves.  Some smoking that affects the comfort and more importantly the wellbeing of everyone else, unfortunate enough to live around.  Then, it should be restricted for smokers to do in your own home.  Families should be able to enjoy meal in restaurant without – without exposing their children from smoking – smokers.  Smoking is a popular habit of humanity.  Everywhere we can see advertisement which says that smoking destroys your health but nobody pay attention to such inscription.  There are many public places where people...
Smoking in restaurants should be banned because in restaurant where all age of people present.  Smoking is harmful for everyone.  Some of them are patient of asthma who badly affect because – because they are the patient of breath disease and they – that is very harmful to – difficult to their breath – in breathing process who badly affect, cause of different dangerous diseases for those who present there.  Cancer-causing germs are also in smoking.  Also – it also cause of different diseases, not for smoker but also others which are present there, affect them badly, and one of the most is – is the pregnant women who are pregnant is – who is present there because it's very harmful for pregnant ladies in – its – in...
I think that the manager when he makes a project of his future restaurant, he should not only think about the visitors' satisfaction or the cozy conditions and you know the impression of his place but rather he should also be concerned about the health of his customers and the guests stay there and he should not allow them to smoke in the hall where there are a lot of non-smokers, right?  Because when a smoker smokes, he does not only damages himself but the people around too and being a lady, being a female, it pinches me when I see pregnant women there like sitting and enjoying their meal and when a smoker comes and smokes and they just get disturbed, they have allergic to smoke.  There is a child who – who – who has to come yet in the world and you are just damaging him, so I think smoking – yes, smoking should be banned in all restaurants and this reason is enough that it not only damages the user but people around them, so yes, smoking should be banned in every restaurant if they...
Smoking should be banned into different restaurants.  It should be permanently prohibited because restaurant is a open place for people.  People visit there; people want to enjoy there, but if one – some people who smoke, they spoil the environment of other people who definitely suffer.  It also affects the health because people eat there and the smoking affects their health.  Then different people take breathe so their breathe will be affect in this case.  This also harmful somehow.  It can be the reason of a lot of loss.  It's – some people – somebody smokes and they will throw the cigarettes down – cigarette down, so because the fire will burn out, it can – it can loss the whole property.  It can loss the whole property.  They can also be the loss of some – some life – loss of some life and it will also affect the rating of the restaurant; people don't want to visit there, everybody has...
The smoking is banned in the restaurant.  In this – in this way, manager should be – should be active in this way and the owner of restaurant should be banned in the restaurant because people affect because of the smoking of smoke and not – and should be not allowed in the restaurant.  The second is today we can see that where is all smoking in the restaurant, there are alcohol drinks in it.  They – this is the way we can up to take that decision every manager cares only for benefit for himself.  In – in this collision [***], I want to say that – I want to say help – should be help for the humans in different ways, because the smoking is dangerous for health, especially for those people are – who are affected by asthma and breath problem.  This is a real cause.  It should be – not should be in restaurant, should be banned in the park, social malls and the public areas.  This is because this is harmful for health and it is some danger...
Well, in restaurants, the smoking should be banned because all people may – all people visit there and some carry babies and families and old guys, everybody is there so those guys who smoke there, they must be affect the environment of restaurant and those guys who are – who are affected by the cause of asthma and breath problem, they must be disturbed because of the smoking smoke, and this is – this is the duty of owner and manager should be banned on the – on these restaurants where the all people – all people visited there and if somebody smokes there and behind this table somebody who are affected by the smoke of people, they – they must be disturbed and go outside, so manager and owner should be active on this thing.  Smoking is a bad thing and not be allowed in the restaurant, and as far as it should – the government take action on it because smoking is a bad and it's – it's totally affect the environment.
Smoking is kind of fascinated thing.  It may attract some people because when the – when they are smoking this thing, it's comforting them but reality is always different.  What is visible inside is different.  The only and one result of smoking is health disease.  It creates disturbance for the people who are having meal around them.  It should be banned.  Yes, we – in the light of smoke discussion, I consider it should be banned because it disturbs the environment and not only that smoking is also injurious to health; it cause many health diseases.  It do create suffocation in the environment, it disturbs the people around.  While we inhale it [***] and people who does not smoke, they disturb other people around.  Restaurant is not a place to smoke; rather it's a place of lunch, peace.  Some people...
Smoking should be banned in all over the country.  Smokers shouldn't be allowed to sit in public places because they are enemy of themselves and the true enemy for others, for public.  So they destroy the environment, the peaceful environment and naturality of the restaurants and public places.  They never – they never benefit for the nation; they are just some – harmful persons and they are just creating hardships for others.  They shouldn't – they don't know the people who are enjoying their – who came there for recreations.  They just destroy all of their enjoyment and recreations and they should be banned; they shouldn't allow.  They must – they – they are – they...
Yes, I agree that the statement that smoking should be banned in the restaurant because it is a place of relaxment, refreshment, and it's also the public place and it's free – it should be free for everyone and one should be comfortable there.  People go there to relax, to refresh and to spend good quality time there and should be healthy environment there.  Smoking is a very unhealthy, dangerous for everyone, even the more who are sitting there, more – more than smoker and cause – cause even more damage to the people around the smokers and – and to the smoker.  And it will also cause damage to the food and cause unhealthy environment and people would feel uncomfortable and not – would have good environment to take food, and also damage can harm the food, food quality, and it is also being ethic and moral...
Yes, I think it should be banned in all the restaurants and other things – other public places because it is quite dangerous to a person who smokes and it is definitely more dangerous to person that do not smoke.  And it should be – it should definitely be banned in a restaurant area because there should – there must be families or other person who don't smoke.  If they – they smoke, they should go outside and smoke because it is quite irritant to all person who don't smoke, and it is very dangerous and it's – this exposure – this exposure of smoke is quite dangerous for a person for the lungs and other things – other – it raise other diseases as well.  Because I think it is quite dangerous for a person who don't smoke to inhale that raw smoke into his or her lungs because a person who smoke, it – it is less dangerous to a person that who smoke and it is more dangerous to a person who don't – who do not smoke.  So I...
I'm agree with this statement.  Smoking is the cause of pollution.  It can damage the natural environment.  It is not helpful for people.  It can – it can hit their health and damage their health.  It should be banned all over the country and inside the hotel and restaurants.  There should be separate places for them to smoke.  They can smoke there and enjoy themselves but they can – there should be ban for those people who can't afford smoking.  The home health can't afford the smoke.  Hotels are public place and smoking should be banned all over the public place.  Smoke can destroy the environment and physical health of the people so it should be banned.  It should be banned in public places and...
In my mind, every smoker should more think about surrounding him people.  First of all, smoking hurts to them.  I think that the manager when he makes project of his future restaurants, should think not only about visitor's satisfaction from food, because conditions their relaxation and impressions from his place.  The most important thing is that he should take care of their health.  He should not allow them to smoke in a hall where there are a lot of non-smokers.  Even if there is a special separate hall for them, manager should take a responsibility and think just for a minute that money is not the first aim of his restaurant, it is that he wants to make people to make more interesting, more variance, there is joyful and peace to their life.  Today, we can see that it is a smoking in restaurants, there are alcohol drinks in it, that is why he come up to the decision that every manager arrives only about...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants because it's really injurious for health.  We – many restaurants nowadays have smoking section – section for smokers and non-smokers but I don't think it should happen; it should be banned from all over the world.  Because it's not something that benefits you, it's something that really is injurious in the interests for your health; even more dangerous for – for people around smoke so definitely it should be banned from all the restaurants, because that's a public place.  Public place should be free of smokers and smoking not a good – and smoking is the very bad habit.  Restaurants should have activities to – I – I guess to train people or train – train or to help smokers to avoid smoking.  They should not promote smoking at all at public space.
Obviously, the cloud of the smoke exactly disturbs other people, especially non-smokers' feeling.  Imagine sitting in a restaurant unable to enjoy the meal because of the smoke, smoke which is coming from neighbor's table.  It – it should be banned because the percentage of non-smoker is actually higher than active smokers, so non-smokers have right to clean air and also second-hand smoke is more dangerous than active smoking as well.  On contrary to this, if you look, the smokers' point of view, it seems clear to him that most people have their opinions against smoking.  Nevertheless, smoking still has some positive aspect to economic side.  For example, many countries around the world, especially you can say the nations like...
Smoking is dangerous for health issue.  Regarding to your health smoking is dangerous, so it should be banned in restaurants and also in public places.  There should be a policy by the owner of hotel or the restaurant so that everyone should follow that policy and in order to abusing that policy, there should be a governmental – a governmental punishment by these people who abuse this.  Our government aims to project us and save us from this society's evil but there are also existence of bad things.  There is a – when there is a positivity, there should be a negativity, so existence of bad things, there is an existence of bad things.  In according to abusing the policy, people should be punished badly but this will cause unnecessary governmental interference in the public business.  This is – this can be destroy the...
I already said that smoking should be banned in public places because smoking is dangerous not only for the smokers but also for the people around them.  Smoking – smokers think that it's just harm themselves but it has a bad influence on the people who are around them, because the smoke of these smoker pass into the lungs of other people and destroy their lungs.  It should be banned in restaurants because it nasty – because of nasty smell and the air – and it also pollutes the air.  The food which is served it also polluted from the smoke – smoke of the smokers.  It has a bad impact on human's health.  Smoking is – I think smoking is very bad and mostly common habit in human life.  I think it should be banned because there should be smoking – and there should be a smoking zone for smokers and not for the...
I think it should be banned.  There should be smoking zone for a smoker and non-smokers in the restaurant.  Smoking is a right of smoker so government provide a separate smoking zone for the smoker.  It should be banned in a restaurant because it's mostly smell spoil the air.  It also spoil the food.  It is served.  It has a bad effect on human's health.  Smoker thinks that it is just harm themselves, but it has a bad influence on the people who are – who are around that...
Yes, it should be banned in restaurants because restaurants are not specifically made for smoking.  Smoking should be banned in all restaurants because it is the place for lunch and to interact with people, to meet them.  As smoking is very dangerous and injurious for health, it disturbs all the people around us.  It can disturb our daily routine, our daily life, so we should avoid smoke – smoking in restaurant, and it should also spoil one's personality.  When people exhale and inhale smoke, it should be – it should very injurious for our health – for our health.  It may cause different serious diseases like lung cancer, so it can also disturb our environment and people – 
Smoking should be banned all over the restaurants because it cause harmful effects on humans and reputation of restaurants, because sometimes people doesn't want to go to these restaurants where smoking is common and they prefer other places with all and it was because smoking harm – cause harmful effect on edible thing and also affect the children and patient.  Sometime in our smoke of cigarettes cause that for asthma patient.  Smoking is bad for health for smokers, and all other people of their surroundings.  In restaurants, lungs of children also affect, which damage our future as well as our population.  Restaurants are the congested areas and where smoke of cigarette cause suffocation and in that place, we don't know who is patient and who is healthy already, but cigarette could be intoxic for both, but for the ill one...
According to my point of view, I told you – I told as well, my – smoking is – smoking – I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  Some people – some women with children are fed up from the smoke and they – people are uncomfortable in the restaurants and they can – they cannot – they cannot understand – they cannot – they cannot understand – they cannot understand the – who smokes – who smoke – who smokes they don't honor their feelings.  When we smoking got pleasure matlab one who is sitting smoking got it but the rest of people sitting along become suffocate.  When...
Smoking in the restaurants, you know, it's – it's really bad.  When I meet someone who is going to the restaurant I think if I'm sitting there, if I'm eating there and if I have the danger like smoke there because as I have told you earlier about, if you – if you go to the research they will tell you that people around smokers are more, you know, because maybe the smoker is inhaling the much of the smoke but half of that smoke is being inhaled by the people who are surrounding him, so of course, [***] restaurants are a place to eat, not to, you know put someone's life into danger.  So what I recommend is that, of course – of course, I agree with the statement it should be banned in the restaurant, should be – should care for the health of others.  If I should smoke, that's my decision but what's the fault of the people who are around me, who – they just enjoy the family time, you know, and they are not...
Many colleges boys and university students, in fact even girls too found the smoking is – that smoking cigarettes – cigarette smoking is something that makes them very cool and very attractive, but sadly and unfortunately this is not the case in reality.  Smoking is something that makes a person unattractive and disgusting and people – the normal healthy person do not feel good to sit in the company of smokers, so I think it is a good and ideal – good option to ban smoking from all over the country, from the – from different – in different countries.  It is a very good step and – and cigarettes smoking and – smoking is something that should be depreciated instead of appreciated by showing different sort of advertisements on tele...
I am do agree with the people who say that it should be prohibited in the restaurants and it should be prohibited in that country because you know that, uh – it – I think it's still prohibited in all the public places because if someone wants to smoke it is his own will.  He should have the – that bad effect of smoking.  There is no, um, uh, fault of others that they should also affect by that polluted smoke.  And, in the restaurant if people come they want a healthy environment – they come there for eating.  And, if someone smoke in front of the – a family – you – who have come in the restaurant obviously that, uh, family will get affected.  The children, who will see that particular smoker will also get affected, may also want to, um, uh, smoke, uh, when they grow older.  So, these things are, uh, bad and, uh, uh, evil is spreading if, uh, the smoking – smoker smokes in front of everyone and...
Um, smoking should be banned in the country and so we should not – someone should not be smoke in the restaurant and the other area because, uh, the work of, uh – the workers also get affect by them and, uh, it will also harm the business and the prime objectivity of the study was to so make the decision between the local smoke, fear, loss and economics of some of the restaurants and bars.  And, um, by using the cigarette and others it also effect the environment of the, uh, restaurants and also the people who are, uh, in the restaurants with their family and with their children and they also get affect by them.  So, it should be banned in the restaurants.  And, um, uh, and it should be significant to banned it.  And, while smoking, uh, uh, of the pub – the public places cause the – it caused – and it caused the suffocation and the disturbance...
I strongly agree with this statement because, um, these are the public places and, um, uh, the visitor, uh – it is, um, for visitor's you know relaxation and their enjoyment.  And, uh, every smoker should think about it – but, uh, think about their strong – their surrounding and the people around him because, uh, it hurts them.  Uh.  Smoking will also hurt them.  And there, uh – and the manager should know that he should take care of their health.  Because it is not all about the money he earns.  He – he should know about, uh, the – the health of the visitor, uh, in the restaurant.  Uh.  If we make separate room for, uh – for just smokers, manager should think about that this is not only about the money but he have to make, uh, people's life more interesting and relaxed.  So, um, smoking in the public places or, uh, in – in the restaurant is, uh – should be banned because, uh, it is...
Smoking should be banned on all public places, if we talk specifically about the prohibition in restaurants and my vote will surely be in favor of it.  It should be banned in all restaurants because not only smokers visit these places, other people also spend their time they are having their meals.  So, while doing so they breathe and when they breathe the smoking environment of the restaurant, it affects their lungs.  There is smokers – smokers – they are desiring need of their body but they unknowing and unwillingly affect the health of others.  It should be banned because the majority of people are nonsmokers.  But despite of this, they have to suffer because of that minority of smokers.  It should be banned because – because of these few people the health of many people is at risk.  The same...
I think smoking should be banned in, uh, restaurants and public – uh, places and it is a well known fact that millions of people die every year from lung cancer as a result of smoking.  So, many countries prohibit smoking in public places.  In the policy, uh, situation smoking policy will be set by the bar and restaurant owners.  And, there should be sections in the, uh, restaurant, uh, for smokers and non-smokers.  To my mind, smoking in public places especially in restaurants and cafes must be banned.  In my opinion, uh, we have to prohibit, uh, the advertisement of tobacco in mass media.  There should be separate smoking zones for smokers and nonsmokers.  I think smoking is the right of smokers and, um, uh, it, uh, it is their, uh, personal problem.  But, it also affects other people, uh.  Smokers can say they just clamed themselves, uh, uh, but it – they don't think that it harms, uh – it – it can create a problem for all the people, uh, who are around the smokers.  And, uh, so that's why there should be a separate smoking zones for smokers and nonsmokers...
You know, um, uh, uh, smoking, uh, caused a very dangerous disease like cancer, heart attack, etcetera.  And, it's that, uh, to make people's life more interesting, more various and carry strife, uh, and peace to their life.  We should avoid smoking and peace, uh – and spread peace to the people's life, uh.  And, today we can see that where it's, uh, smoking in restaurants there are alcohol drinking age, uh, that is why we come to the decision that every manager cares only about benefits for himself.  After visiting such places people begun to smoke more often because every man wants to go somewhere to relax, to meet, and to talk to friends.  And gradually, they become dependent on smoking and would not able to drop his – this habit, uh.  Also, from a nonsmoker together with them.  In conclusion, I want to say that people, uh, you know, uh, should not be indifferent to each other.  It's a real problem.  And also, smoking must be banned in not only restaurants, uh, and public...
According to my view, yes restaurants, uh, uh, yes smoking must be banned at, uh, restaurants because, uh, restaurants are places for, uh, having meal but not for smoking.  Uh.  The – the place, uh – the place that is for eating must be kept, uh, hygienic and, uh, not be polluted in any, uh – in anyway.  Uh.  To smoking in the fumes environment becomes suffocating and uncomfortable.  It's really hard to breathe over there in, uh, in any kind of smoke and, of course, uh, smoke, uh, having a lot of, uh, chemicals in it that is, uh, through smoking that comes through smoking they are obviously, um, not good for health.  And, um, uh, the place like restaurants there used to come, uh, families.  Uh.  And, uh, uh, along with them are, uh, children that, uh – for – for whom it, uh, smoking is really a bad thing.  So, um...
As I am not a smoker so I would be going with yes, it should be prohibited in all the restaurants, all the restaurants of the country because smoking makes a man mentally, physically distorted.  It causes cancer and certain other diseases which are – which are harmless – which are very harmful for human beings.  So, as I am not a smoker my point of view would be, uh – I will be answering yes that it should be prohibited in all the restaurants.  Looking at the fact that, uh, almost 50% – I – I would say that 50% of the people as far as my university environment is concerned don't like smoking.  So, uh, depending on this little – this little claim I would try to say, uh, that smoking should be prohibited in all the restaurants.  So, we can get a friendly, fresh, healthy environment in the restaurants to enjoy yourself to enjoy our delights, dishes...
Smoking should be banned in the restaurants and the public places as well, uh, because the biggest misconception of the smokers is that they harm only themselves when they smoke.  But, uh, in actual, uh, they, uh, harm the – everybody who is near to the smoker.  Most of the people visit the restaurants when they are free or they want, uh, enjoyment with their family, children, um, and have a good time.  But the nasty and the irritating smell of the smoke spoils their good evening and the good day and makes you upset.  That's why it must be banned.  But on the other hand, smokers also have their rights so, uh, they also want a good time with their friends at restaurants by talking on the – any topic or, uh, while they are smoking.  So, smokers say, uh, cigarettes are good to feel relaxed.  And, um, uh, smoking helps many people to relax.  Many people like to smoke before exams or when they are relaxing with friends and, uh, it even improves concentration.  As for me, I speak for the people who are against the smoking in restaurants because...
There should, uh – there should be smoking zone for smokes and nonsmoker in that it harmed, uh – it harmed the air, also affect the food which is served.  Smoking is – smoking is non-ethical habit and people who smoke – and people who smoke they affect the society because it is injurious for health and it is – it is, uh – it is injurious – it is injurious for health and, uh, people who – people who are sitting, uh, with smokers can also affect bad – also affect badly.  So, it is again, uh – so it is not allowed so it is prohibited in our religion due to – due to its nasty and harmful effect.  So, smoking should be banned.  And, it is banned – and it's – and there should be – and there should be, uh, legitimacy and there – and there should be legal, uh, action take against these, uh – this prohibited habit so...
Smoking should be, uh – uh, so smoking should be banned, uh, in all the restaurants and all the college and universities and all the food places because restaurant is a place where we sit together and eat food.  And, uh, the smoking who – the smoker who is sitting next to us is very harmful for the food.  Food is a healthy thing and smoking is injurious to health.  Uh.  Smoking should be banned at all the public places.  Uh.  It give us a bad impact to their viewers and the watchers.  Uh.  The – a smoker who has, uh – who is smoking at the public place or at the restaurants where we enjoy food with our family friends, our family friends and having a good time, it, uh, uh – it gives a bad impact to the smokers and to the us where to go – who do not use to smoke, uh, the, uh – it – it lessened the taste of the food and it gave a...
Smoking is not bad but doing smoking in a public area or a restaurant is bad because the people sitting around us they feel, uh – uh, they feel irritation while, uh, due to the smoke coming from the cigarettes.  So there, in the restaurant there are families, children and some other peoples who don't like smoking.  So, smoking must not be done in a public place or a restaurant.  Uh-huh.  There should be a proper place for a smoking where the smokers can smoke and they have enjoy.  Smoking in a public place must be banned because it causes lots of disease.  It, uh, it causes lung cancer.  Lung cancer or the mouth cancer.  It affects the children, uh – health of the children a lot.  Uh.  It also affects the, uh, atmosphere of the restaurants because the smoke coming, uh, uh, it give us some bad impression on the restaurants.  People doing smoking in the restaurants, uh, uh, must be banned because, uh, the people, uh – other people don't like this.  Some people like the smoke, uh – smoking in the restaurants because...
I agree with that smoking should be banned from all places in around the world because it is very injurious to health.  Smoking can kill you.  A lot of disease – if you can smoke you should have lung cancer.  And, when you have lung cancer it is very dangerous for your health.  After a year – if you cannot cure it after a year or two you should – you are going to die and that's very bad for you and your family.  Because your family depends on you.  Smoking is very bad and that is, uh, uh, – and that's very bad for you.  Smoke – you should have to cure this.  If you don't you are sure you are going to die and that's very bad for you.  Smoking can kill you.  Smoking is very bad for you and that's why you should do very wrong with yourself.  Smoking is very injurious to health.
As I mentioned earlier, it should not be prohibited at all in all the places.  So, one should be smoke, uh – it's up to his will, uh, whether he – he wants to smoke or not but one should be respect to the other people as a human being.  So, he should, uh, try to avoid as much as he can.  Uh.  So, other people may, uh, not get rid of it because some people get serious problem – problem with the smoking and they become bored and feeling not well in their company.  So, one should, uh, uh – if one should avoid this as much as he can.  If it is not possible for him, uh, because it effects the other – our health as well as other health so if one should not able to control himself so he should smoke – smoke anywhere – and anywhere at any place.  One should not get rid of it because he wants, uh, uh – he also wants, uh – to, uh, respect the other...
Um, according to my point of view I am, uh, told you – I told as well, um, why, uh, smoking is for – smoking, uh – I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants, some people, some women, the children are affected from the smoke – smoke.  And, there people are uncomfortable in the restaurants and they cannot – they cannot, uh, and they cannot understand, uh – they cannot – they cannot, uh, understand – they cannot understand, uh, that who smokes – we – who smokes – and who smokes they won't – don't know their feelings.  Um.  When we are smoking about pleasure meaning one who is sitting smoking is okay but the rest of people sitting around become suffocate.  When...
No smoking at restaurants.  It's a good thing if people simply follow this thing but restaurants are the public places.  Though certain restaurants have some sort of smoking rooms as well where people can easily smoke but at certain places as well, there are no windows open where the smoke can be emitted or blown out, so at public places the things like smoking should be completely banned because most of the people of every age do come at restaurants, whether it be for the sake of enjoyment, for fun, for meeting, for learning, for lunch and for recreation purposes, so it not only add to the pollution, not only contaminate the environment of the restaurant, it also harms the health of the human beings.  There might...
You know, as for – as, uh, it concerned I mean the whole country smoking, yeah, you know, people somehow, uh, they, uh, uh – somehow they must allow, uh, for this habit because, uh, uh – because people, uh, cannot, uh, uh – but, uh, smoke, uh.  So, they must, uh, allow.  There must be some separate place outside the, you know, outside or in a private area they may go or in a unpopulated area they may go and, uh, they can have smoking because, uh, uh, it is, uh, okay for them and they just want to do.  Otherwise, in families and, uh, uh – in populated, uh, areas – in, uh, populated areas they must not allow.  Even, uh, now the, uh, brand of cigarettes, so okay, they are, uh, uh – they are of different...
I think smoking should be banned because it is not good for health.  It is in – an unhealthy activity.  It affects our nerves and brains in such a way that we become completely useless and it's not good for health and moreover all it's not allowed in religion.  It intoxicate a person and when a person gets so much used to this bad habit and when he don't find smoking materials, cigarette, and many other things, etcetera, he begin to borrow these things from others and in this way, his self-respect is harmed, and he – and he is not able to financially support his or her family that's why it's a crime to society.  There should be a straight – strict campaign against – against this bad habit in our country, and it's – it's not a healthy activity.  People indulging in this activity...
The public area about smoking is completely different.  First of all, I must say that every country should ban smoke because it is a very unhealthy habit.  It will affect your lungs and – bad effect on your lungs, so I am completely disagree with this activity but especially in the public places, it is really awkward and irritating activity for the other people who are in front of these chain smokers.  Because different people have different attitudes and responses, they may feel irritate and they are not relaxing that in such places, so there must be, I think, a special side area for the chain smokers where they are freely allowed to smoke and that the other people may not feel this type of irritation, or there may be childrens around them and it has bad effect on their...
Yes, I am agreed with this statement that smoking should be banned in the – all over the country especially in the restaurants because I think that it is harmful for a smoker, not only for a smoker but also for the people who are breathe in the toxic air, and there are certain advertisements that say that smoking destroys your health but smokers do not pay any attention to its inscriptions.  And I think that every smoker should think about himself and about the people surrounding him as well.  People who smoke are most likely to develop diseases like lungs cancer, liver cancer, so I think that it should be banned in order to reduce the pollution and the diseases and significantly reduce the risk of heart attack for the smokers and the other people who are non-smoker or the children, and in case of...
Smoking is injurious to health.  Smokers should be banned throughout the country; throughout the world.  They should be given exemplary punishment.

Due to all these cancer, a patient or a – or a person can't stay anymore, so they should be banned in the Pakistan or all over the world.  The structures present in the lungs of a human being should be destroyed due to over smoking.  Also, the whole – the body should be affected.  The circulatory system and the circulation of the blood which is a – a whole due to the presence of oxygen.  If our blood don't carry oxygen properly and our each cell present in the body don't carry oxygen then obviously the cells which are present in our body should be dead.

Yes, smoking should be banned at all the restaurants in any firm and in any country because it will create a very harmful aspect for the persons who come in – in their restaurant just with the food purposes and eatable activities, because the most of the persons just came – come here to the hotel to the – for the environment which they like there as a peaceful environment and the persons come just for the neatness and cleanliness of the environment of the hotels, but if there would also be pollution of the smoking and the smoke and the persons who do smoke definitely they will have – don't have any idea that how much that affects the health of the other persons.  Some persons are highly allergic to the smoke of the cigarettes and it will create a negative impact of the hotels and restaurants and so the staff members of the restaurant, the mangers, the waiters, the waitresses...
Smoking is really a harmful for the health and the smoker only not affected by this, the surrounding people also affected by the smoking.  Smoker is taking smoke – smoke through filter but the other people around him take the smoke without filtration and it will more harmful for them, and it will create the disease of cancer of lungs mostly, and mostly smoker dies due to this, and if the – it is prohibited from different places like theaters, cinemas, offices, hospitals, etcetera, so we can get relief from these diseases and we can overcome the diseases with our – this and it will really create a very health – healthy atmosphere, healthy society and it will give us a good co – situation and we can – we can do the work in a peaceful situation.
As I was saying that – my topic was given to me that was the smoking and I was telling that it is very injurious to health in regarding the cancer and mouths and lungs problems, and in addition it produces the pollution and as – when our parents and young people could buy cigarettes and smoke pretty much and we are even in hospitals ads are there to promote but it is not good, it is not – with the – we have bad habit of smoking and it is very bad for our health.  Smoking is almost restricted or banned in almost all public places and cigarette companies are no longer allowed to advertise but there is advertisement going on in our TVs and magazines.  Almost everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and emphysema and heart diseases.
Smoking is very dangerous for young generation.  A – young generation is the backbone of any country but the smoking effect the young generation very badly.  Students and young boys became addicted of the cigarettes, therefore their lungs and their throat, their system of – nervous system affected very much.  Therefore it's a – it's very dangerous for health and for – for the – any nation for – any nation and for any people it's very dangerous.  Smoking ban is – is a good step if government take decision.  Government should take – do the different smoking bar in different public places like...
Hi there!  This is XXX, a student of doctor of physical therapy.  Smoking is declared haram in Islam.  People smoke even in public places which is dangerous not only for their own health, but also affects the neighboring people.  It's the main reason for lung cancer, heart disease, and many other diseases.  It's not ethical to smoke in public places, but unfortunately, our people do this.  Smoking should be completely banned - completely banned - it should be completely banned in public places and our government is also taking steps for this, but some improvement in implementation of law is still required.    
It damages the health of smokers and the passive smokers.  The second reason is smoking may be a disturbance to the people around it.  I believe that smoking should be banned in public areas such as restaurants and airport terminals.  It damages the health of smokers and people around them.  Cigarettes contain 4000 dangerous chemicals which may cause lung cancer, bronchitis [ph], pneumonia, and other diseases.  This cigarette is destruction both to you smoker and to innocent people, so at least try to smoke in your room with your door shut.    
There is always a lot of people there.  When one individual decides to light up the cigarette, everyone around him has to breathe in nicotine from the air.  Secondarily, it is strongly unforgettable [ph] for nonsmoking people to get into a bar or restaurant where cigarette smoke found.  For instance, when family with children wants to eat out, they usually look for a place for nonsmokers in order not to let children have a contact with unhealthy smoke.  Finally, if smoking was banned, there would be fewer smokers on our streets.  Psychologists have proved the young people are more likely to acquire a bad habit when smoking is commonly acceptable in society.  So, when this prohibition was imposed, perception of people would certainly changes.    
I agree with this statement because restaurants are places where we go to eat and relax.  We go there to have a nice time.  We go there to enjoy a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.  We feel comfortable there and like to sit there and enjoy.  If there is smoking all around where you dine and relax, how can a person relax and feel comfortable in that unhealthy environment?  So, I agree this restaurants should be spared from this evil and smoking should be banned completely there.  I agree with this statement because restaurants are place where we go to eat and relaxed.  We go there to have a nice time.  We go there to enjoy a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.  We feel comfortable there and like to sit there and enjoy.  If there is smoking all around where you dine…    
I am totally agreed with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and other public places because it's a risk point for our autoimmune system, causing problems of cerebral system, causing problems to bones by decreasing their density, causing problems to our heart, our blood vessels by their – by the diseases like arthritis, can affect our lungs causing breathing problems, can affect our vision by decreasing our far point, can cause cancer of cervical, lung cancer, mouth, and many others.  It can also cause the pollution of our environment by polluting our air.  On the other hand, smokers are not much bad because I like – because I like smokers and their attitude which they show when they are smoking by using cigarettes so that there seems…    
Yes, I am strongly in the favor of this issue because at one hand public law does not allows it, and on the other hand, regarding the general etiquettes and manner, it doesn’t look nice to smoke at any public place.  Mostly, there are signs that doesn’t allow smoking in most of the restaurants, but people doesn’t care.  Mostly, people are so addicted and some other use it as a fashion so they don’t care that where they are using it.  Moreover, smoking is injurious to health of not only the smoker but also to those who move around the smokers.  It leads to lung cancer and various oral diseases.  So along with restrictions, these people must be made fully aware of the negative effects of the smoking on the health so that not only restaurant but also public places should be safe and the smoking should be reduced to a greater extent.    
Yes, I agree with this statement that smoking should completely ban at every restaurant because smoking is not good for health.  It is a fashion.  Nowadays, people adopt smoking as fashion, but they do not think that this fashion is not good for their health.  Smoking is injurious to health.  It cause many disease, especially heart disease.  This habit is increasing among new generation.  Their parents forbid them, but they are not paying any attention.  They go restaurants and smoke.  Smoking should also ban at restaurants; might be due to this, this habit will decrease among people, but one day they think that their parents is right.    
I agree with this statement because restaurants are places where – where we go to eat and relax.  We go there to have a nice time, we go there to enjoy in a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.  We feel comfortable there and like to sit there and enjoy.  If there is smoking all around where you dine and relax, how can a person relax and feel comfortable in the unhealthy environment?  So, I agree the - that restaurants should be spared from this evil and smoking should be banned completely there.  I agree with this statement because restaurants are places where we go to eat and relax.  We go there to have a good time, we go there to enjoy in a peaceful and healthy atmosphere.  We feel comfortable there and like to sit there and enjoy.  If there is smoking all around where you dine and relax, how can a person relax and feel comfortable in the unhealthy environment?    
...be completely banned on all the restaurants of the country because smoking is bad for our further development of our country, for the – for our working progress.  If smoking - our young children are – are interested in smoking, how can we compete with other countries of the world?  So that our government have to - should have to completely ban on the restaurants - on the restaurants and smoking.  Most of the children - most of the students are interested in smoking because they – they – they thought that it is very - it is very good thing for the children and - for the children so that we – we can - we have to do it for betterly.  If our countries are not progressing, how can we…
