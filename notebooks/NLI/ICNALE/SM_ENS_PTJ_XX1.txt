In my case, I would agree with this statement at least as an American when you're trying to get a job after you graduate from college, a lot of companies want you to have experience and having a part-time job or something of like, maybe a paid internship or whatever, would give you experience in the field that you think you want to work in, and I think it's also a good way to decide if you actually want to do that job for the rest of your working career. Uhm, another good thing about having exper – or doing a part time or like during college is that it makes you or it gives you more contacts in the field of your choice.  So, if you – I know a lot of students who after their third year of college, they did an internship or a part-time job for the summer, and if they do a good job may be the company will invite them back and then if they do a good job again, the company might actually offer them a job.  So, it's sort of, uhm, using – having a part-time job can sort of the considered as step to...
Well, basically, yes, I do agree that students should have a part-time job because of the fact that university is not cheap and a lot of students have to, like, ask their parents for money to pay it and sometimes the parents may not have the money to supply them – but on another – on another note, I also disagree because kind of part-time jobs actually get the students unfocused, make them focus on, like, work instead of like actually doing but the work, the student work and yes. That's how I feel about the situation.  Yes, yes.  So part-time jobs – but overall I think, yeah, students should have like part-time jobs like university student definitely.  Yes.

I believe that yes, students should have part-time jobs.  A lot of students that go to school are not living at home like mommy and daddy, so they cannot support them.  As far as I go, I need a part-time job to support myself.  How else will I be able to buy booze?  I would like to buy some types of pornography.  Who doesn't like pornography? If children live with their parents, they don't need a job.  it's totally fine.  But they are also spoiled little brats who don't know the meaning of a dollar or the value of a dollar or don't know what it means to actually work or have a work ethic.  So, it's truly in the eye of the beholder.  For me, I think they should.  They need to learn how to take care of themselves.  Nobody is going to take care of them forever.

Yes, I think it's – I think it's great for university students to be able to have a job, reason being is because students will have the experience of being in a job atmosphere and also they can balance work with school.  This therefore will give them an opportunity to understand more about real life and how to balance themselves and kind of make better judgments about what they need to do. This will therefore in turn make better leaders and people who understand the value of a dollar by working at a – and going to school at the same time, they'll basically have experience that they are going to need once they finish college and start into a real career.  The career they are going be going into may have something that they have done in the previous past and if...

These days some people say that it is important for a university student to have a part-time job, I agree with that because... Oh, I – I think I messed up, can I fix it? [***] I believe that it's important for part-time job because it shows the work ethics before you have a real job in the real world and for people who don't have a part-time job and they don't have any support for money it is, a great alternative for having extra cash.

I believe that it's important for college students to have a job – a part-time job because it proves that they can maintain a study world and also complete other tasks that are unrelated to studies whilst also maintaining a social life.  And it's important to be able to complete different activities that are mildly unrelated to each other as it shows you are well rounded and kind of well-developed human beings.  And future employers may look for this kind of experience when they try to get a job in future. The part-time job itself is not necessarily important.  However, the effort that they put into the hours of their work is always very important – it's important to stay diligent and it is important to remain focused and...

For college students these days, I believe, it is a good thing to have a part-time job because it helps them acclimate in this society a lot faster, especially when they graduate.  Not to mention whenever you graduate, you already have a resume kind of already set up to where you can go right into maybe a – maybe not an entry level position but maybe one or – first or second tier position, thus increasing your pay rate after college.  By doing that, you also help in paying off your loans because you have the higher pay rate. [***] Okay.  Other than that, a job can also kind of serve as...

I think it's very important for college students to have a part-time job, especially in the United States the college is very expensive and I know that without a part-time job I wouldn't have the money to pay for my books or for things that I need.  And I actually have two part-time jobs working in the same place doing different things and it's a really good experience to be able to have, sort of, the workload of having school, which I try to do very well in and a part-time job and it's a good learning experience to be able to find out how to balance my time so that I'm working and doing homework and going to class and trying to be involved in other activities as well.  I think it's good preparation for the real world and I think it's just difficult to be able to get by in school without having money, and I really – I really like my job and I think that it...

I agree because it's important for college student to get experience in a work environment as well as gaining knowledge in whatever field they are studying.  And just going to school without working part-time, they don't get that work experience or experience in a working environment aside from possible internships, which not everyone has the opportunity to get, also many internships only last for perhaps like one semester, whereas having a part-time job lasts throughout the school year, is a permanent situation.  Also it'll – it teaches students, you know, how – how the real world is where they will have to always – I suppose always work hard and they are not going to have very much leeway...

I think it's a good idea for college students to have a part-time job.  Of course it's completely optional, but it helps balance life between study life and actual work life because once we graduate we all have to work, so it pays to at least keep that in mind in preparation for graduation. Personally for me, if I stop working for a period of time, I forget how it is to work, so when it is time for me to work again, let's say, after graduation, I may not be prepared for the work environment and it may be a little bit more difficult for me.  However, I am sure I can adjust and I'm sure other students can adjust just as well, just it may be a little bit difficult if they have no work experience before, actually working after graduation.  So, yeah, I think it's a good idea for a...

As a college student, I think it's definitely important to always consider either having a part-time job or securing a part-time job for yourself or full time after graduation, and in that regard I think that you are – you fall into either two categories where in the first category you are – well, in my case I'm studying overseas and for students who travel overseas, either they have some kind of scholarship system which supports them in which case they are financially rather stable.  But then, there's also different cases where that financial support falls out and the student has to worry about their income and finances by themselves where they don't have support from parents or from scholarship programs, and in that case I think is almost mandatory...

So, these days if you don't have experience, you will most likely not able to get a job.  People who graduate, uh, without any work experience are usually stuck in what is considered in Japanese are pre-job, so they – you can't progress – you can't get into your chosen field.  If you don't have experience in a job you also don't, uh, it takes longer for people to introduce you things, easier to employ someone that already knows a basic understanding.  Also time management is something important that people learn when they've got a job and studying at the same time.  These things are important in order to share that someone is professional and able to get the job done.  There are other things which affect whether you're going to be employed, uh, for example, grades, but I think these days, uh, people are more interested to see how well your life experience is like, people who also are older who are going back to study now and so, uh, it's not as simple as it used to be, you need to be able to be equipped and able to respond in...
I think it's very important for college students to have a part time job, um, having a part time job teaches students good time management skill.  They have to learn to prioritize things in their life between studies, work and their social life.  Having a job, uh, shows them that they need – there are certain things that have to come before having fun and they need to work hard to make sure that they still do well in school and also balance the importance of having a job.  Um, having a part time job also helps in be more grateful for their education because they have to work for it and they have to earn it, it's not just given to them by their parents or by someone else.  They have to work very hard to get that education that they want and they learn how expensive it is and what a sacrifice it is to be able to go to college or to university.  Um, I also feel that it teaches them to be more responsible and more mature because they have to focus on things other than just...
I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job; it's now a full time if they can because they need to support themselves and they need to learn how to work.  I think that once you are a college student, you should be taking care of yourself and you shouldn't be relying on your parents to take care of you because when you graduate they won't be taking care of you.  Yes, it is good that parents can help a little bit but if you can at all possible try to take care of yourself as much as you can, it's learning to be more independent and learning how to become an adult, getting that work experience that you need so when you graduate, it is also important to learn how to work with other people, to learn how to work in the world that you're going be living in after you graduate.  And it's always good to earn money and to save money because you never know what happens in the world that we're living in right now because there is so many...
I don't think it's necessarily particularly important to have a job as the college student.  I feel like it depends on the person.  For example, if you need the money, um, it's a good way to earn the money and learn responsibility so handling your own accounts and so on.  But if you don't need the money or if you prefer to stay studying and really focused on your academia, then I would say that it would be better to focus on your studies than to get a job.  But this does depend on the person.  There are some people who can do both, and it's wonderful way to expand your horizons and gain a load of real world skills as opposed to just economic skill.  So, for example, you can learn how to deal with customers, um, improve your communication skills and handle money, learn different responsibilities that you wouldn't learn just from academia and I think that's really impo...
I agree with the same and the college student should get a part time job to be able to cover for their expenses.  Many college students these days have college expenses that they need to afford; food, living and transportation.  Many college students want money to be able to support themselves while they are still in school.  So I agree with – with the same and that they should get a job while they are in college, at least part time– part time, half a time which means that they will have time for their studies and they will have time to be able to work so for the expenses.  I also think that college students will benefit from their part time job because they can gain experience from a part time job and they will be able to be able to pay the money as much as they want to pay for the future or for – or for colleges...
I believe that the answer to this question to say that it is an important thing, would be too deterministic just to say yes.  Firstly, you have to consider the factors of the course in which the individual is undertaking.  For example, if it's a language course, they have to devote not any time into classroom practice with the language but also they need to practice outside.  For example, my course is, um, it stays for, um, as well as the time in class you should have 24 to 30 hours of Japanese practice, oh, um, a week, um.  Whereas, you might argue that some courses is easily manageable to undertake a part time job whilst doing the course.  Um, I do personally believe that it is deterministic just to state this for all courses.  Um, it's feasible when you consider...
Yes, um, I do believe that nowadays especially in, you know, America and then the state that I come from, New York, there is a lot of kind of students that need a part time job, uh, because of the fact that college is expensive and its fees is expensive, not only tuition but the cost of textbooks and those other materials that you will need in school and a lot times parents aren't – college students aren't able to fully provide for their students tuition needs.  And also there is, you know, financial aid itself but most people aren't qualified so that's more complex that either, um, even if someone you know is they don't consider themselves well up financially...
Yes, I think it is a good idea for a college student to have a job – part time job while they are in college, helps them to be able to keep the payments – parents to be able to have enough money in their account to make sure they are paying their bills on time.  It helps them to not need to take out student's loan and also helps them to be in a work field that may be beneficial towards the course of study they have chosen for college.  It's best to have something like the bus schedule, that way they don't have to skip class or miss work to accommodate for the schedule at school and at work and they should be able to also have a job to help them –they used to having a job but they will have when they...
I think whether or not college students should have a part time job is very situational.  I think some college students in the situation that they are in that is their only option in order to support themselves because they need to have that inflow of money.  I would say probably starting your junior to senior year definitely not, but for your sophomore year having a part time job would probably be a good thing just to get your foot into the workplace and to have built your resume.  I think freshman year, it's very important that students are fully focused on what's going on in their college and getting clubbed in, building relationships that will carry them through the next three following years of college.  But I think right away if you have a job, then you are going to – you're going to lose time that you will get to spend building connections and really making memories on a college...
I think that it depends on the field that a student is involved in, in that college.  I know for my field to be in speech it is very possible and very good for me to work a job because it gives me the opportunity to speak with people and, um, learn more people relation skills.  But I think for major such as nursing or medical fields, it's better for them to spend their time studying and learning more about their field than it would be to stress about a part time job.  Also, in medical field students build up so much debt anyways, a part time job might not make a big of a difference whereas their grades could be more important.  But I do see the benefits of having a part time job in college.
It's quite an interesting topic as to whether a college student should have a job or not when they are at college.  It's also a very loaded question.  It depends on how much the society that you're actually existent to especially students to pay for their education as well as pay loan debt from the government.  They're all – can't – pass the process of learning.  But also it's from my perspective very interesting because I am an older student and as a result for me, I actually quit my job in order to go to university so I don't really – I want to focus on my education that I – that I have to work in order to stay in my living whilst at university, it's actually something that I [***] because I feel that that's kind of like strange situation to be in.  Of course, we're also in a situation where whether or not you can afford to go to the university or not, it's also very, very much part of this equation.  The cost of going to university is increasingly becoming more and more expensive and the governments also...
Although, there are some benefits to holding a part time job while in college, I believe that the risks outweigh the benefit and here are my reasons.  When I first started college, my father told me to be careful.  Even I would need to work and help pay for my tuition, but he said, and I think he is right, when you work away from campus, say, at a restaurant or a bar or a hotel, you work with many people outside of the university, when you spend your time with people outside of the university, your mind is often distracted from the things you might be trying to learn.  We often learn best after class when we have time to process the information that we had.  So I think although the money is important and many students need it, I don't think that it helps the...
I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job.  It shows their own responsibility that they are taking the next step to becoming an adult.  It also shows that they take part in providing to their education if their parents are paying for it or even if they have scholarships that they are contributing to their own effort and money that they are working towards.  This is important for college students to have part time job because of these reasons.  This shows responsibility and it shows that they care about their future and future careers.  It is important that they give importance of their careers and that they care about the careers that they are going into and have experience in one, often job look...
I agree with this topic.  I agree with this topic because a lot of students nowadays need to pay their own way to school.  In school nowadays it's getting extremely expensive like the school that I go to, every single year since I have been there tuition has gone up and the financial aid that my nation is giving me is not enough to even kind of half the tuition for a two full semesters.  So with that pay, I have to work a part time job just to, you know, hope to afford me to eat, to have gas money, to pay for my book and just to have very good living expenses.  And then even on top of that I still may have to pay for  --  for the school.  And then having a part time job although is not always the easiest choice at school, it is good because it teaches you the time management.  So, I think a lot of students get part time job, not just for, you know, the -- 
Part time job, I definitely agree for college students to have a job while they go to a part time – part time work or full time work even to just pay for your college degree and to understand budgeting and also understanding life.  I know many people that know how to study and be a book smart person but they don't know how to live a normal like life to be an adult to have the responsibility.  So if you're just asking your parents to pay for it, that's just – I think is such a waste of time.  So for college students, they should definitely work and also earn their money, learn how to budget and then go to college.  And also try to understand time management through that.  So, I agree for students to work part time, work full time.  I know single moms that work full time – mommies full time and also going to school full time so why can't other...
Well, yes, I agree definitely that a college should have – college student should have part time job because when – it helps them pay the bill and it helps – um, it helps them learn how to balance their time efficiently whether, you know, after they get off work, they need to get prioritize and either get studying right away or you know they need to catch up on some homework.  So definitely yes, the part – a part time job helps a student to – to learn how to balance their time and to definitely learn how to pay their bills and help them gain work experience as well and helps them and learn how to, you know, have a good work ethic as far as, you know, they can have for the rest of their life.  And they can also meet people in their part time job that can help them – help them in later on in – and what in their – as they want to pursue their – their own career and maybe get them farther along, get them a good job that will help them pay and support their family, so yes definitely a part time...
I think that working part time during school especially college is very important because it keep you from having a lot of debt when you graduate.  Especially, in my country, lots of people graduate with thousands and thousands of dollars debt.  A part time job during college can help keep you from going into too much debt.  It can give you a lot of experience in the workplace, which is important after you graduated because if you haven't worked anywhere when you graduate college, it's very difficult to get a job no matter how specially our major might be.  Many entry level jobs require prior experience which can only be found by working in high school and college.  It also grants you independence which is important.  Uh, many students after they graduated are...
Yes, I think it's important for college students to have a part time job, perhaps even high school students to have a part time job.  My reason for this is because personally from experience I was a shy kid grown-up and again a part-time job while at college, it helps you come further out of your shell, obviously develop as a person, getting to know new people skills, thoughts of different people and that's definitely important in the society.  If I was an employer looking for someone through the crew, you know, I want [***].  I want a self-experienced people because I want to bring the best – best possible person into business there someone who you can carry on.  And people who haven't had part time jobs haven't shown the initiative to move forward in the world, so to speak, you know, it's how the whole things look, it looks lot better shown – it's got part time job, you know, and speak second language.  It's all CV building and, you know, encourage them like that but also gives them decent somewhat far more...
I agree with the claim that a college student should have a part time job during their course of study.  From personal experience, I did not have a part time job while I completed my undergrad studies.  Already, I can see how a part time job would have benefitted me by giving me the necessities of job experience when I graduate college.  Having a part time job during college has the extra stress of having to balance work with schooling.  Some people can do very well on just the academic side and then when they go to work outside of school in actual jobs to apply what they studied for in their undergrad degree, they have trouble meeting deadlines or anything else that a job requires.  Having a job is different than studying, you are required...
So it would be good for any students who have a part time job because they need to have their extra income.  They depend so much on their parents and also they have [***] but students who have some previous experience in any job, in any kind of jobs, never had to related to a course exactly and it's really – it's somewhat – it's possible to have a job related to your course and studies, so it's really good to have part time job while – what I can say more.  I didn't do my preparation, so I am sorry.
I believe that it is very important for kids to have a part time job while they are in university.  Even while people are at a university, they still have large amounts of time that are often left unfilled.  If someone does not have a part time job, they will often find themselves getting into trouble.  Often it is a common expression in America.  gIdle time is the devil's best friendh.  I just had a part time job from my last 2 years of university and I find that it is very beneficial in teaching me the value of hard work and also to teach me that things will not be just handed to me easily, you have to work very hard for them.  I have some friends who do not have a part time job and often they are getting into trouble.  One friend who is...
Hi, yes, I would agree that, um, college students should have a part time job, um, for the following reasons.  Um, the first reason I believe that it's important for college students to have a part time job is that it does help subsidize some of the costs of going to college and I believe that it's necessary in today's age, especially I am in American universities and the cost of higher education.  Um, I believe that to keep from incurring further debt especially after college I believe that it is necessary, um, to work and to be able to – to pay off those – those college debt and to be able to pay as soon as possible.  I think doing that through college is a good thing if we are able to do that.  And so that – those two reason...
Yes, I agree that it is important for college students to have a part time job because it will be very difficult to pay for classes and supplies without the money.  It is also important to gain discipline and structure to be able to convert that into college and completing the course of works necessary.  It is also useful as a way of spending time doing something important and useful rather than partying or doing drugs which is not necessary.  A part time job offers many opportunities such as socializing and gaining new connections that will lead into the future for future employment.  It is also  --  the important aspect for the college student -- 
I agree students do need a part time job because in – English universities require 9000 a year, so it is really expensive when it heads up after 4 years of studying, especially because you've got expenses of living – where of your living – most students aren't living at home with their family still, so you've got good expenses from that or food and travel to university, so you need to have a part time job to like sustained life while studying at university.  But then the problem is that the more you – the more you are like working at your part time job when you are supposed to be studying, the worst you cannot do your studies because you can't study and work together obviously.  So I think you do need one because it is not realistic not have a part time job, you're going to need the money but it also kind of takes away from your studies, so I think that it is good to have part time job but maybe one that's not too kind of regular, say, you don't like take away too much time and get bad grades at the end of your university study because that kind of defeats the point really, that – yeah, that's pretty much...
Hello.  I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job.  First reason that I think it is important for college students to have a part time job is because that it teaches them responsibility, it shows them that they need to show up to a job on time and that college just isn't all about fun.  Secondly, I believe that college students should have a part time job because it helps them manage their time better.  They can't just use their time however they want, they must go to class when they are supposed to be in class and then they have to go work when they are supposed to be at work.  Thirdly, not only does a college – should a college student have a part time job because it teaches them responsibility and it teaches them time management, but it also provides them with income, so they don't have to depend on their parents all the time in order to get money...
I agree that it is important for a college student to have a part time job while studying.  The reason is that while the student is studying, he may work and earn an income to provide for himself whether it would be for books, whether it would be for food or any other necessities that he may need to bring his stay in college.  It may be distracting, but it will also teach him how to multitask, how to manage his time more wisely and most importantly he will learn the importance of earning money for himself, the importance of making sure that he can support himself so that he can study for school and so that he is able to balance time wisely and it will look great in his jo...
Thank you very much for your question and then for my opinion, I think that students should be allowed to do part time job.  My reason is because some people do not have scholarship while some people have scholarship and whereby other people do not have scholarship they can't afford – afford to pay their rent, they cannot afford to pay their fee or their tuition or keep themselves up here in Japan.  And then things are really quite expensive in Japan.  So for those people who have scholarship they don't have any problem at all living in Japan, but for people who do not have scholarship I think the institutes allow them to do part time jobs in order to like stay in Japan because without money, without – no funds, you cannot really your house rent, you cannot – you cannot recharge your home, you cannot really buy things to...
I did not think anyone should force someone to have a part time job, but if you want one, you can have one, if you don't want one, you don't get it.  It really depends on a person and you might not have a part time job that they have a hard nature and then you have to study a lot or you might need one to need the money so have benefits to have one you can learn responsibility and you can have lots of money and use it to pay your bill or whatever.  But if you don't need to work and you already have nice [***] extra plan to study and do well and you will [***].  So, overall you can have one if you need it and if you don't need it.  I don't think there is any disadvantage to not having one but if you want to have one, you can.
...or they want to support themselves if they graduate with debt – have, um, if they graduate without, um, with a debt – if they graduate with a debt, they're going to able to pay a lot more easily.  If they work while they are in school, it's even though they pay – it's easier for them in the future to pay the rest of the college debt at all, while when they graduate how to deal – deal debt at all.  Especially nowadays with everything being so expensive – so yeah I do believe it isn't – that it is important for college students to have a job while they are in school but where they can have much assurance that they won't be in debt after they graduate or very minimal debt or not at all.  Okay.
I believe that it is very important to have a part time job even while in college.  I believe that it helps a person maintain their goal in mind and to work towards that while they are at college.  They are also able to, um, build their work ethics, um, hardworking, maintaining a job, keeping a job, and possibly even finding out what kind of job this person may or may not enjoy working at.  Also gives them a chance to have a place where they are responsible for their outcome, not just in college while working, um, for their degree, um, sometimes a person may not even be working, uh, paying their own way through college and so having something on top of that where they are responsible for...
I believe that it is good for a student to have at least a few hours of work while they are in school.  Um, if they are an American student and studying in the US or they are native to the school where their college is located, I think it is very doable as long as their major is not overly demanding.  If they are international students and still struggling with the language, um, then I think it is probably not even official to have a part time job if they need to, focus more on their studies because it will be harder for them.  But I do agree that having a part time job is very beneficial, first of all because it, um, provides the source of income during college years and also because it helps students to budget their time.  Uh, many students who don't work don't learn to budget their time as well and therefore they end up throwing it away in many cases, um, uh, of course there...
Yes, I believe that it is important for college students to have a part time job, first because it develops responsibility.  It first develops responsibility and budgeting both money and time.  For money, it becomes second probably because students who do part time job more clearly understand where the money is coming from, it's not just being provided by their parents, it's something that they have worked hard toward, so they'll be more responsible in budgeting with where it goes, whether it goes to tuition or something find or, um, books or laundry or whatever it needs to go.  Also helps with budgeting time because students with part time jobs will have not much free time and students who do not have part time jobs, they will have to kind of prioritize and have some times for them to studies and some times to get at work and time to rest and also time – more responsible in spending how to better budget their time.  Uh...
It is very important that a college student should have a part time job because it teaches them character, it teaches them how to work hard, it teaches them how to balance his life, um, working hard, it teaches them how to also be underneath employers, um, teaches them, uh, um, work underneath them with respect and  --  or how to follow instructions and also maybe growing leadership so that they can perhaps become an employer, businessman, you know, um, a manager.  Um, building character or making the skill, um, it's great because it teaches them to like go to work every single day and also work on having a good attitude of how being there, working hard also, doing things right, um, just learn to be a good steward of, um, as God says -- 
Though I think it's important for college students to have a part time job, I wouldn't say it's necessarily important, but I think it is valuable in a sense to people that need one.  Uh, for me, I needed a job through college and I had it part time because the job that I worked was only operating from 8:00 to 4:45 and that's when my classes were.  So, I think for people that have to have a part time job through college, it's very valuable for them because they have to pay their way through college and so they actually – uh, I think they value their – their degree more because they had to work for it and not that they – that other people didn't have to work for their degree, but they had to work a little bit more to earn their degree and another thing it helps with is time management.  There are a lot of things that you have to deal with...
Yes, I believe it's important for students – high school students to have part time job because from personal experience, I realized that it's good at a young age to start working.  It helps you, um, build character and providing for yourself and also interacting with people and it teaches skills that you can use later in life.  Even if they are not directly related to your field, it teaches that you can interact with people.  It teaches you to deal with this whole circumstances as well with difficult people.  It also helps you work alongside, um, a team as well as follow authorities and those are qualities that, uh, that you will need later on in life and so even if you are working at fast food or if you are working at a job that doesn't seem to be what you're going to do the rest of your life, it's still helps, um, prepare you – your character for, um, later, um, job occupation...
Um, I believe that college students should have a part time job.  There are several reasons why.  One would be it helps to instill a very good work ethic.  Um, another would be that I would say majority of the time students do have the time to work, but for whatever reason whether it is that their parents are paying for it or somebody else, uh, you know which is not to work, but I think that having a  --  a part time job helps you kind of you get out there in the workforce and, um, it gives you experience in different areas.  They can also help provide money for you.  Even if you do have parents that are helping you pay for college, having a part time job can help you get you money now so when you're out of college, you have a little bit start up with.  Um, I think having a part time job is going to help with you scheduling because whenever you -- 
I believe it's a great opporat – a great idea for people who are talented to have a part time job because first it teaches responsibility because those who are talented quite often are ones who take for granted their ability and don't have to work hard to get places in life.  So, to have a part time job would teach them to pretty much how to supply for themselves, have team work and to get along with other people and pretty much have to work to support for themselves.  Another reason for them to have a part time job is to learn team work where they have to have social skills and – and get along with other people and relate with people as well.  So I believe that highly important for people who are talented to have to have a part time job.  So, in other words, it's been pretty much supply for themselves, they would become pretty spoiled and...
I believe that all college students should have a part-time job while they are going to school.  Having a part-time job while you're in college will teach you some life skills that you actually will not be learning in the classroom, um, like how to manage your time, how to provide for yourself, how to budget.  Uh, you learn to appreciate more things, uh, like money and what you can do with your money.  You appreciate your education because you are actually spending on it; it's not being given to you, you have to work for it.  When you have a part-time job, you understand that not everything comes free that you really have to spend a lot of time on both your education and providing for that education.  Also, if your part-time job isn't something that you necessarily desire, then you will have more incentive to comp...
Having a part-time job helps you because you need to, uh, be able to pay – pay for your bills and your college bills, you need to, uh, pay for your college books.  It's really hard because if don't have that, it's hard to study, and if your parents aren't going to help you, you won't be able to, you know, finish your – your education.  And a part-time job can also help you raise a little bit of money.  And, you know, you get hungry in college so you also – you need to have some money so you can buy some food in, as a college student you get really hungry and if you don't have some money to buy some food, you know, you're not going to have much to eat.  And, it's very important too because there – a lot of times when you come to college and towards the end you, uh, have a big bill – bill to pay and if you don't have your parents' support like I said...
I think that it's a good idea for college students to have part-time jobs during college.  You can see it as when employer see it on a resume, they see it as both experience and a demonstrated interest in that career.  It's also a really good way to make connections with hopefully future employers.  I know a lot of students who have done a bunch of different part-time jobs as they were trying to decide what they wanted to do after college and having one random part-time job experiences change their whole career and they – it changed what they thought they wanted to do.  So, I think they can be really in – influential on what one decides to do after college.  There's also a good way to make connections with future employers.  Uhm, if you do a good job during one internship, the employer will remember you, they will be more willing to write a good recommendation letter for you, they might recommend you personally to someone.  It's just a good all around benefit I think to do a part-time job during college.  Uh, there is a lot of other things that...
Yes basically – yeah definitely part-time jobs are important but sometimes they can cause like – students are like not focused on their academic work, so – yeah that's how I [***] about the situation especially from what I've seen like a lot of students like come to class like tired and then they fail the exams because they worked like too hard the previous night or previous day, yes. So that's how I feel about the situation.  Yes.  Thank you for listening, over and out.  Roger.

Yes, college students should have jobs.  They need to take care of themselves for a video game and prostitutes and porn and booze and marijuana where it's legal.  I like video games.  I have to buy video games.  I cannot – I cannot afford them if I don't have money and I must have a job to have money.  Bitches want guys that have money. My favorite color is blue.  My number is 7.  I enjoy long walks on the beach.  Call me sometime, though you don't have my number.  But umm, looks like it's going to rain.  it's a beautiful day outside.  it's very breezy.  Quite sunny in Philadelphia.  No, I'm in Japan, go figure.  I hope you enjoy listening to this.

Yes I think that it is – possibly it's better for students to actually have a job after they finish rather than while they are in school because it now gives them a chance to be able to use the skills that they have obtained while working in school, and once they get out they will have a career and start their career, they'll be able to start using their skills that they learn in their other jobs and how to be able to manage their lives and manage their time with I'm guessing with the – I'm sorry, I guess the best thing for them to do is to have a job while they are – while they are working.  Anyway, the fact is that when a student has a job, they basically know the value of a dollar.  They know exactly how to manage themselves and prepare for another career outside of college.  Being in college is very stressful and...

it's important to have a part-time job because it shows your work ethic and how hardworking you are.  If you can maintain that work ethic, it will be good experience for when you graduate university and get a real job that you will be working full time at as well as having a part-time job is great for extra income when you are in school, if you are supporting yourself on your own which is very helpful for students who will – maybe be in debt from college later, so they must have extra money currently to pay for that debt.  In addition, I think that working multiple different types of jobs gives you more experience and life experience later on that you can apply to your real job in the future after you graduate university.

it's important for college students to maintain a part-time job while studying because it proves that they can be a well-rounded individual.  it's very difficult to maintain an active social life whilst also working different hours and juggling different schedules for classes as well as the immense amount of homework that can be given.  So, an individual that can actually manage all of this and still come out rightly sane is always well kind of regarded by future employers and it's even better if they can also complete an internship in this time, however that's supposed to be for the human types.  Yes, but I definitely agree that part-time work is important for college students.  I really hope the time runs out now.

For college students these days, I believe it is a good thing to have a part-time job because it helps them acclimate in this society a lot faster, especially when they graduate.  Not to mention whenever you graduate, you already have a resume kind of already set up to where you can go right into maybe – maybe not an entry level position but maybe a one – first or second tier position thus increasing your pay rate after college. By doing that, you also help in paying off your loans because you have the higher pay rate. [***] I have to babble continuously.  Oh okay, other than that, a job can also kind of serve as...

I think it's really important for students to have part-time job because it teaches them about balance between work and the rest of life and it can be a problem because sometimes if you have too much homework and you have to go to work – I know that last year there were times when I didn't go to sleep until really, really, late, 2 or 3 a.m. because I was doing homework after my job.  But it's really nice to be able to have the money and to learn the responsibility of balancing school and work and just sort of having that independence. Having a part-time job has enabled me to be less dependent on my parents and ask them for less because I have so much of my own and I think that that can be a really important life skill because a lot of students don't know how to do that and it's just very important to be able to do things for yourself, pay rent yourself, buy groceries yourself, especially as a college student I'm learning how to be an adult in the world.

I agree because it's important for students to get experience in a work environment as well as gaining knowledge in whatever field they are studying.  Furthermore, they may – they may not have the opportunity to work for very long if they were to get something like an internship whereas having a part-time job allows them to gain experience in the workforce throughout their college time. Also, it will teach college students the value of hard work, how to, I guess, not – not be lazy and to constantly – constantly be on the move.  There will be little free time which allows for very little slacking and it teaches students to prioritize their time for assignments for maybe even – even their free time must be prioritized as well as obviously work time.

You know, like I said before, it's really good that students should have some kind of part-time work before graduation because they help us to get used to the work life and scheduling ourselves and managing between working and studying.  So it's a – it's a good habit to have to have.  Of course it's completely optional.  That's all really I have to say about this topic. Other than that if it's any job, I would love to work a job that deals with what I learned in school, so as an art major I'd like to have a job that deals with art in some way.  Or fashion.  Oh, that would really prepare me for after graduation.  So, at least I could tell my boss I have experience of something.

If you don't have financial support outside of school, I think it is definitely important to have a part-time job and be able to at least afford some type of luxuries outside of your regular routine and I think that one of the biggest issues today is student debt and having to take loans.  And if having a part-time job is going to reduce the amount of debt and as well the – it will increase the amount of fund that you can have while you pursue your academic situations and definitely part-time job is definitely a requirement.  But there are also cases where students are blessed and have parents which financially support them and in that case it's really a part-time job is more of a bonus, I would say, to prepare you mentally.

If you did not have a part time job while you were studying, you are less likely to be employed.  I agree, uh, that – with the statement that you need to be able to have work experience in order to be more employable in the future.  For example, if you don't have experience, then it's going to take longer for you to be employed.  They train you certain things rather than if you already come with the foundation of an understanding.  Lots of it is time management issues that are involved.  If you're studying and working at the same time, you know how to balance thing – these things against other curricular activities as well.  Also, people skills, people can come out of education with, uh, no grounding in the workforce also can be very hard to work with if they don't have, you know, the, um, ability to work in difficult situation.  There is also the effect, um, that everyone is moving around these days.  You don't have a set career anymore, that is very fluid, it's translut – it's very translucent in the fact that you don't know where you're going to be in the next couple of years, so you need to be already equipped in the range of different areas, so it's better to start early with your work experience and...
I think it is very important for college students to have a part time job.  Having a part time job teaches them to be responsible and have more time management skills.  Students who opt to have a part time job while they are in school have to learn to prioritize and to organize their time in such a way that they can complete their studies, do well in school but also be able to hold down that job and earn a paycheck.  Students need to be able to realize that there is more to life than just parties and hanging out with friends, they are doing whatever they want, but they also need that responsibility of knowing that they have to go to work, they have to make money to be able to achieve  --  provide for themselves in the life that they want to live.  And also at the same time that they still need to study hard and get, um, good grades in college and be able to learn enough to get a better job when they leave one day and feel like, um, it also teaches students to be more grateful for the opportunity to go to college, not everybody can go and if they have to work for it and they -- 
It is very important for college students to work and to pay for their own bills, to earn money and to save money, especially for their families that they might have and other plans that they want to do when they graduate, for vacation, for getting married, for buying a car, buying a house, buying an apartment, because when you're done with college you're basically on your own, uh, you should be prepared for the world that we live in.  It is also important that you work hard so that others will see maybe your skills so that you can maybe work in a supervisory position and that way you have to rely on others to take care of you because it is not the jobs that take care of you, it's your job to take care of yourself.  It's your job to work hard because if you don't work hard, you won't get anything out of life, everything...
Yes, I think it's really important to be able to learn those skills, but I think you can learn those skills at any time during your life and it just depends on how late you want to learn them.  If you feel the need to actually focus on your studies and not get a part time job, you can easily get a part time job straight after university or even during the summer, um, while you are not studying because you can continue to learn the skills, um, in holidays or after university.  You don't have to learn them in – whilst you're in college.  I mean it's good too because then you go out into the real world straight away with these skills when you will probably more likely to get an interview or you get a job because of the skills you've gained.  But I don't think it's very, very important.  I know that there are people who are wonderful people and can get good job without having ever had a part time job but – so some people want to really improve just the general way...
I think college students will benefit from part time job because they will be able to help them to gain access to minutes by minutes and I also think that it will help them cover their college expense as well as their living in campus.  Many college students have expenses like food, uh – an – and they got transportation expenses that they need to cover in their own because their financial aid alone doesn't cover their expenses.  So many college students need to get a part time job to be able to cover those expenses on a daily basis.  Many college students are suffering because they need to cover those expenses that they cannot afford while they're living in campus so that's why many college students, they decide to get a part time job.  I agree with this statement because it helps them get experience but also help college students afford their expenses while living in campus.  I live in campus myself...
Again, as I previously stated, I believe that it is too deterministic to merely state that it is an important thing to have a part time job.  You have to consider the factors which – again what the degree that the individual is undertaking, whether it's a language or business qualification.  Um, it can be all important when considering aspects such as, you know, sustained – sustaining or living but again I believe that the maintenance – student loans do provide enough for an individual to be able to undertake education without a part time job.  Then again it would be too deterministic for me to just answer it this way, and you have got as well as the course you have to consider the factors within the individual's life, you know, they could be from a less stable home or economically stable home or, um, again maybe they just might have expensive taste, they may want to as well as go to university – be – be able to afford to have fun, but I believe...
Uh, as I was saying, um, because the tuition is still high in America, especially in where I live which is New York City, a lot of students have no choice but to have part time job because even though they have, um, parents, they are not necessarily able to provide [***] dollars to pay the fee for tuition and textbooks and other materials that students will need for school.  So, you don't have the part time job, uh, pretty much sure the way that that people can't – get to pay that they need, uh, however, [***] also to have enough time studying because they are taking not a good job, they have to go to work, etcetera so they do not have extra time that they should...
I think it is a good idea for a college student to have a part time job while they are taking classes during the semester and it's better than a full time job and that they don't have to spend too much time there and can devote, um, a great amount of time to their work.  And it helps just taking out studentsf loans, if they have the job, they will have to take out student loan or they can allow them to take for any studentsf loan so they had to take out.  It also gives them the opportunity to get any experience in their major if they have a job that goes along with what they are studying and it also helps them to be able to get used to holding down a job which they will need to do once they get out of college and take on a job in what they are studying currently.  If they have a job, it's a good experience all around because they get somebody for what they are going to do, as well as giving them the money they need to do what they have...
I would say that it's important for definitely juniors and seniors in college to have a part time job because at that point, um, they are looking at eventually being involved in the workforce and so it's important for them to be building their resume and to be gaining skills.  Um, particularly for freshman probably, also for sophomore it's nice to have extra time, um, to really be involved in campus life and building friendships and relationships which the part time job would obviously distract, and might be particularly for freshman when they are new and they are trying to find friends.  It's nice to just be able to focus on campus life on adapting to what college life is, is really about and learning how to do college life well, balance your time, studying with, hanging out with friends and – and really having total free time for the first time.  Well, I would say, um freshman shou...
I definitely think that it is important for students to have a part time job in college, um, but I do think that it also depends on the major that they are seeking out in that college.  For nursing majors and medical majors, it might be very difficult for them to work a job and learn about their field because of how grueling and time consuming it can be.  Uh, also, they are  --  they build up so much debt in that process that it is a small dent to work a part time job where you could get better grades and possibly get a better job in the future to pay off this debt.  But I do see the importance of having a part time job because I have one personally and it helps me learn a lot of people relation skill and time management skill and it gives me a good work ethic to manage -- 
Who should to have a part time job whilst in education or – but students to have part time job during education is more a question of you should support the burden of students going to university, and that's a problem I think because people want you to study when – study at university.  And they give you work and workload that's acceptance of the standards in university, but they don't really be able to give you flexibility or time in order to cope with a part time job.  This becomes an issue especially for me when I was doing a language course where you're expected to put 60 to 70 hours additional and classroom time into your study.  There is no time in that equation for you to have a part time job as well.  Yes, it's essential for an awful lot of students to have a part time job simply to even exist at university because the loans the government give you simply aren't enough to sustain in existence, especially in London where it is so expensive and it doesn't matter what...
I think there are many benefits to holding a part time job while in school.  One, of course, is the money.  Many students need that extra money to help pay for their living expenses or even their tuition.  However, I don't think it is essential and in fact sometimes I think it goes against the goals of education.  I say this because often the best learning that we do is outside of the classroom we process the information that we learn during the day.  Sometimes, we need extra time in order to complete our homework assignment or look into a subject area more thoroughly.  If we have a part time job or even a full time job, we often spend our time with our coworkers and make them friends but many of these friends are not college student.  This can be a major distraction.  They can lead us away from our educational goals...
I think that it is important for college students to have a part time job.  It shows responsibility and their hard work – work ethic.  It is also important that they take part in designing for their own education by your choice.  Another good point for, um, part time job is that it gives them clear experience.  They may choose to get a part time job in the field they wish to go into.  Also, I can say part time job looks good on resume and often after completing college when it is – a college student have a part time job, it looks good to future employment and I think that that's important to –to show the employers that they took multi – multiple responsibilities, al – also pursuing a quality education and that they took part in paying for their education.  In that way, part time can be very stressful and I think...
So, about the part time job, we think a lot of students get a part time job not because of the financial reason but also for, you know, life experience.  You know, a part time job can help you with time management, can help you with money management, can help you with, you know, getting your foot into the career path that you want to be in for the rest of your life.  So having a part time job in college can have good and bad effects.  I think as we continue to go on, you know, and gaining in education for the next 2 to 3 generations, they will have to have part time jobs because like I said school is getting extremely expensive and the financial aid that it offers to most students probably won't cover in the school and that will allow the students from the school for scholarships, a bigger minor  --  majority of that do not go to school on scholarships and a lot of students are coming from first -- 
Yes, definitely, college students should have a part time job in order to have life study and be life smart and street smart and also be book smart as well.  So, that is why I agree for college students to have a part time or full time job while working – going to school full time.  And it says please continue speaking so, yeah, why not.  And if people are lazy then they should not even go to college and just start making that money right now.  It says 10 seconds, so I think that's it, or if my comp – don't know if it's locked, no, it's still working then it said 10 seconds though.  Oh, it didn't say 10 seconds probab...
Yes, the college students should definitely have a part time job because it helps them learn, uh, one – or some have – help – help someone learn to have good work ethic.  It helps them to balance their time and helps them to pay their bills and one – a good work ethic is always something excellent to – to always sharpen and to work on because it helps them with their – how they live their life and it helps them gain work experience in their job.  It helps them to get in contact with people later on after they finish college, that can help them get a better job.  And it helps them pay their bills which is always a grip like one of the number one things that prevents college students from going to college is the – is the bills and all the finances that are involved so definitely yes, a part time job does great things for college student and helps them, you know, further their – helps them further their time there in college and it's definitely something that's valuable in education and anything that helps someone further education, it is definitely...
The most important reason why I believe that part time works during college is important is that it decreases the amount of debt after graduation.  It is important because when you start working, your money doesn't have to go toward debt.  It can go toward a new car, a house, establishing your life for yourself.  If you have debt, you can spend the rest of your life essentially paying off your debt and being concerned about it while interest piled up.  If you work during college, a lot of those debts are already taken care of, especially if you're at college, if you work and pay off your school debt to save time.  This also grants independence because you don't have to go back to your family and ask for help, which is important when you are trying to become successful human being.
As per the comment– kind of from the last one, keep part time – the part time job, I think yes students should because it can keep people independent and money knowledge skills in that.  They are independent, they are on their own money, they can buy things, they can manage the money and that's important skill a lot [***] and that will help them a lot making those move forward, balancing the money so maybe want to take [***] further themselves also obviously give them people skill and a professional environment depending on by the work, you know, the customers you've got to converse, you've got to talk to your boss correctly, another skills that are very useful in any jobs, uh, of course any work and life.  Obviously, it also gives them key strength to go and progress their thought and if – that's how you're going to university but once you get to 24, if you don't have that work experience, it shows a lot about your –now it's been what – a third of your life – living a third of your life and you...
Having a part time job during college not only gives you job experience for after college, but it gives you a dedication that helps people be more diligent.  Um, having a part time job during college, you have to balance school work with your job.  You are required to do things for your teachers academically.  You are required to do things for your employer at your school.  Having a part time job cuts down on study time, so you have to be diligent and know exactly when you need to study from your study habits.  So, having a part time job does help in narrowing down and helping a person.  It forces a person to evaluate what they need to do more closely and to fit a lot more into a shorter period of time.  Having a part time job gives work experience.  Some...
So, it's good for students who have a part time job during their college because if you have an extra income, you do not depend so much on your parents, should have received by future employees if student had some experience.  And it doesn't have to be matching [***] to your course.  It will be any job as to just select, you know, just to – look like a student who doesn't only go just uni and bump around just probably through some job, it made a little easy.  It is good – it is good and sometimes have job, part time job, and it's really necessary to work on holidays if you really want to – really pursue their studies because it's really hard to – if your parents can't provide for you throughout all this...
I believe that it is very important for young adults to have a part time job while they are in college because I believe that it enforces the values of hard work.  My parents told me that I need to have a part time job because they want to teach me that nothing in life will be handed easily to you on a silver platter as we would say.  Many of my friends who do not have part time job often have too much free time.  They often are getting into trouble and creating mischief as hooligans.  I believe that if they had part time job, then they would be better in doing  --  get better doing with their time.  They are often not being and doing bad things, if they had a part time job, they would make better use of their time -- 
I believe that college students should have a part time job because it enables them, a) to pay out their debts faster.  I believe that being in debt is, uh, a irresponsible thing to do, and so I believe that it is – it's not only good to pay it off.  I believe it's also good, um, in order to help subsidize that cost that you would incur during college.  So for those two reasons specifically, I believe that it's almost necessary with the cost of college, um, in today's day in age, especially with the economy and the, um, the problems that could be incur, especially after college as well, um, dealing with debt.  And so – and so I think that this would be the – the best alternative to not working in college students incurring debt and then having to pay for after...
Yes, it is important for college students to have a part time job because of the discipline and social networking skills that will be gained.  The money is also important so that you, one is able to pay for classes of supplies, without the job no one will be able to – uh, be able to build social networking skills and – and future friends and, uh, financial security through the process of working part time even though it is difficult to work part time in the 10thschool full time.  One must be able to try to balance those together and – and figure out in equilibrium so that one can, uh, succeed in life.  Without the part time job, no one will be able to get anywhere and they would live on the street because they could not afford anything, especially in the country here in the United State...
I agree, students do need a part time job as well when they're studying at university because otherwise it's too expensive and you have to like travel a lot and buy lots of books and other things in university.  So you're going to need money for that because obviously get it for free.  But then when – uh, again it kind of takes away from your studies because you can't study and work at the same time and it gets really important to do well at university because you're spending a lot of money there and getting in debt but then you need to have a job at the same to be able to have sustained life.  So, I think most students do need part time jobs unless they are lucky enough to be able to have their parents to pay for the student fees outright and then they can spend all their time studying which would be much better because then you get much higher grades and then a better job at the end of it, which is what I want to do.  But unfortunately, my parents can't afford that so I am going to have to do a part time job and continue working while I study and making sure that it doesn't take away too much for my grades because that's the most important thing; otherwise, I can't go to Japan and study.  So, yeah, that's pretty much it.  I think you do need a part time job.
I believe that college students should have a part time job for three reasons.  The first reason is because when college students have a part time job, it teaches them responsibility, taught them that they have to show up to the job because the job isn't going to say, “Oh you can just get whenever you want.”  It also teaches them, um, time management, so it teaches them that they need to show up on time, but it also teaches them that they need to plan their days well.  They don't have seven 73 hours during the day to do whatever they want, they have to go to class and go to work and get homework done all within 24-hour time period.  Not only does it teach responsibility and it teaches work ethic, but it also teaches, um, work – uh, give them an income.  This income is good for them because then their parents don't have to provide them much money, they have their own source of money.
It is important for a student to study and have a part time job at the same time.  The reason is that while he is working, he is able to earn money so that he can support himself whether he is buying textbooks, whether he is buying food or whether he is buying other necessities such as toiletries, etcetera.  Another reason that it is important for students to have a part time job is that while he is working and studying at the same time, although it can be  --  it can prove to be a major distraction in either area, he will learn important skills such as time management and he is able to properly and successfully manage his time between his workplace and between his studies.  And he will learn how to become a more well-rounded person and when he is able to go out into the workforce after his studies have completed, he is able to apply for a job and put that on his resume and so -- 
Thank you very much.  Like I said earlier, it's really good to give students part time jobs like give them opportunity to go for part time jobs because it's going to help them like, um, for their upkeep, like get money for their upkeep because they are not on scholarship.  But for those people who are on scholarship, it is okay for them not to work but other people who are not on scholarship should be – like should be given opportunity too, like go for part time jobs in order to keep them self-work going here in Japan.  Like I said earlier, things here are really expensive so because of that people should be giving chance to go for part time jobs.  I think it's really worth it, especially here in the universities like many people, international students are being offered scholarship while some others are not offered scholarship, so I think it's really, really a good thing.  Yeah, that's my point exactly.  And...
If you have a part time job, it can be good because it teaches you to schedule your time objectively because you have to schedule time for studying and plan to working and all that.  But also it could be bad if you don't have any time to study because you're working so much.  So you have to remember that, the reason for going to school is to study so if you're doing part time job that can give you a lot more time for studying, do well but if you don't have a job just because you're lazy and you want to play videogames, it's not good.  It's better to study so if you're not going to be studying, you should have a part time job.  But if you mean to study, then it's okay not to have a part time job because you might have a lot of debt in school but eventually if you study well purposely you should make more money, you can pay debt, so you have to choose whatever suits your personality, of course.
I – I believe it is important for college students to have a job while they are in college because it provide – provides students to have an opportunity to test their skills, um, even while they are – have a hands-on job because with hands-on job if they choose pursue that whatever job they are in that also coincide with their major or whatever.  Uh, they can apply their experience that they have on the job to their classes, especially if they are business major or what – whatever for a business.  It also provides them to have graduate debt free if they are working, um, in college itself.  So, I do agree with – I do agree it maybe difficult to balance academics and – and a job, but it will be worth it all to get expe...
I believe that it is important for a college student to maintain a part time job, um, while they are in school.  Some of my reasons would be, um, that it would give this person, uh, credibility, um, as far as, uh, work job history but also, um, give them the experience in their field, um, to maintain their debt and job ethic to work hard at it.  Also, um, it might help this person realize some jobs he or she may not enjoy or may enjoy and, um, might want to change their job, um, career preference, um and what degree that they are working for.  Another thing that I feel like is important and that it gives  --  a part time job will give is responsibility of owning up to their own work as far as having -- 
I believe it is good for a student to have a part time job while they are in college because it provides a source of income for them.  Um, also it helps them to learn better time management skills.  Um, I worked – I worked part time all the time during college and not only did it help me to learn the balance my time but it also, um, helped me to gain more experience in the field of teaching private music classes where I – I work and I think it was very valuable because it's, um, provided another field of expertise, um, and not just filled up a bunch of hours.  And, um, I think it's good for building relationship with other people outside of your work or your normal major zone.  I think it's good to learn to work for a boss and learn to have to obey rules that are put over you.  And, um, I think it is good for, uh, also living to work with difficult people if that happens...
Yes, I believe that college students should have a part time job because it teaches the responsibilities – it teaches responsibilities first and budgeting.  The first thing they will budget is their time – the other time, they will learn how to plan because they want as much free time as students who do not work.  Since they will have as much free time they've to plan around their work schedule and plan around their classes, they will be able to budget their time better and prepared being ready for work and doing studying and doing their homework and preparing for their work something that they need to do every day.  So, they will learn the responsibilities to budgeting their time wisely and prioritizing what's important and what's not.  Another area which they will be able to learn budgeting is money.  Due to part time jobs, you feel more of an ownership with the money rather than parents are paying for them so they will begin to budget money wisely, worked hard for it, and they will begin to plan what needs for their tuition, what they can have [***]...
It's great that a college student could have a – a part time job.  I believe that it's the best situ – best thing that a – a student could have, um, because it teaches the – the student to build character through, uh, working at an employer, keeping a good attitude for the employer, employees as well and keep a good honest integrity, for working hard and grow and being able to lead also possibly.  Um, it would also be great for a college student to have a part time job because they could earn money and put that towards, you know, there is a college bill or life after school such as for house, car, family, any other bills that might – made or – may arise.  It would be quite wise for a college student to have that job.  It would also be great for college student to have a job because if he could build character and...
I don't think a part time job is absolutely necessary.  It – I wouldn't say it's imp – important for a college student to have because there are many people that go to college that don't have a part time job and maybe that allows them to focus on a lot more academics than someone that does have a part time job to be able to do.  But it is valuable to people that have a part time job I think because I had a part time job going to college and personally I believe it – it helped me value my degree more.  It – it made me concentrate on time management which is something that we have to deal with to our whole lives.  Um, I had to juggle my job.  I had to juggle my – my classes and you might not have just one class, you have, you know six or seven classes that you have to work with.  So having a job added on top of that just it's another element that you have to think about when you are in...
I believe it's very important for young chil – young people to work at a young age because it helps build a character that they can – the qualities – work qualities that they can use later on in life.  I think it's valuable for them to learn to work with a team as well as work under authority and you can learn that in primarily any jobs even if you start at very young.  I worked at McDonald's when I was very young and I – in high school, I learned that, um, working with people was not as easy as it perceived and it taught me patience as well as, um, how to figure out situations on my own and then to follow authority as well.  And that was valuable and that helped me when I went to college and worked at, um, more higher-up job that I could work well with people and then I could, um, follow instructions and follow authority and get job done well and quickly and efficiently.  And I think that high school should have that experience younger...
Uh, part time job has many advantages for college students because it helps them to be out in the real world and experience real life thing that helps them to earn extra money for school.  Um, having a part time job is a great way to meet with people; it is helpful for building a good work ethic.  Having a part time job also, um, just makes you more diverse person because not necessarily are you working in your field and then we have a part time job in college.  Um, part time job helps you with scheduling because you have to be a more scheduled person when you have more things in your life and you have to re-arrange your priority.  Um, having a part time job for a student is very helpful, um, and giving you different skill-sets and giving you different, uh, a different amount of knowledge in other subjects.  Um, having a part time job for a college student is a great thing.  It, um, helps you to deal with...
I think it's a wonderful idea for people who are talented to have to take a part time job because first they have to learn to provide for themselves.  Quite often people who are talented are spoiled and they don't – aren't used to having to work to get things accomplished because they naturally get things done without much effort.  So to have a get part time job, they have to provide for themselves, they have to work for a living and they develop how to be very responsible, just take care themselves.  Another reason for having a part job is that they have to have teamwork and learn to get along with other people and to co-op to get a job done.  So that it – it's a vital skill for them to be able to deal with other people and work along with other people as well.  So, um, first reason for them to – it's important that they have to first be responsible and also have to work with team work and the final reason I think you need to have a part...
I believe that college students should have a part-time job while they are in college.  Having a part-time job while you are also pursuing your education will teach you to value more highly the things that have to work for.  You learn to budget your time, you learn to budget your money, you learn that not everything can be given to you.  When you're working a part-time job in college, oftentimes that job will not be in the degree field that you are pursuing, so it will be incentive for you to complete your education.  It gives you the resources that you need to do so.  Um, college does not come free so when you're working for it you are actually putting yourself through school, you're giving yourself those opportunities that other people sometimes have handed to them.  When you're working for something that tends to mean more once you actually achieve it, which is the goal of education to teach you how to...
...bill to pay and that bill could be a huge one.  Now, if you have your parents – if you have your parents' support in college, it comes in handy and even then you should have a part-time job because then even though your parents are helping you, you can have a part-time job and be able to save some money or have some money to, you know, just spend for fun.  But most importantly if you don't have, uh, parents helping you with your college bill, um, that's a – that's a hard time.  So, a part-time job will come in handy because then you can, you know, earn some money and then towards the end of the semester or college career, you, uh, can pay your bills, I mean the bills are the things that hurt students the most and you wanna finish your career, right, you wanna be able to learn and study so after you're done with your college, you can go and get a job on the world.  Well, having a part-time job helps this because, you know, you have lot of bills to pay and I am in college...
