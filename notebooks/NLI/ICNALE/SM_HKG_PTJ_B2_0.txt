I definitely agree that college students should get a part-time job.  First of all, if that – they have the ability to do so, so they should do so as simple as that because college students in Hong Kong, most of them they work part-time as private tutors for secondary school or primary school kids.  Perhaps not all of them would like to be a teacher when they graduate, but this kind of process is something that earns the money, so that they can be more financially independent from their family.  So – so as long as they have the ability to do so, I think they should.  And the second reason would be working part-time can get you experiences to face your future better, to equip yourself with better preparation, like if you are working in an office, you would know how is it like to...

Yes, I definitely think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job because even though it may be hard, like students have to study in the morning and work at night or they have to work in the weekends, it will deprive them of their free time and rest times.  I think it's hard but it's worth it because – well, actual experience is not like studying.  You can never get what you – what it is – what – how practically, when it – when you just read in your university.  It's very important that you really interact with the people and learn from them and – and they will give you advices and learn from the advices like that.  So, I think it is very important that the students get part-time jobs.  And because it is also – gives them a taste of what the industry they are interested in is actually...

I don't think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I have mainly three reasons.  The first is that, I think having a part-time job can enrich a student's horizon and will not be limited to his school setting and I think it is probably important for us to be exposed to the social environment.  And through this conduct we can enhance our social skills like communicating with other people outside our schools.  And my second reason is that it is responsible for us to earn – to make some money and support our family, although we are still in a college, we are mature enough and old enough to support our family or – as well as earn some money for ourselves.  And the third reason is that I think college student is mature enough to...

I agree that college students - it's important for college students to have a part-time job.  Firstly, most of the college students are adult, they should be responsible for your – the money to maintain their life and if they get – if they get a part-time job, they can fulfill the financial need on their own.  Moreover, college students are going to work in the future and they should have the related experience while their studying.  This will help them with their future occupation and they should have experience...

I think students should have a chance to do a part-time job because they need to learn some hands-on experience.  For example, they have to know how they can, how their knowledge will be needed if we can apply to the – to the – to the – to the society.  For example, to [***] classic and learn English and then apply their English on both and their writing [***] or if they are going to be a teacher, so they can be a part-time tutorial – teacher, so that they can learn from it.  They can learn from how they teach students in different practical ways.  Yeah, so, I think, yes, college students do the part-time job when they are still in college time.

Yes, I agree that college students should take part-time job when they are in college.  First, because I think this would provide them with some economic support of themselves and sort of share the responsibility of their family.  And in that sense, they would be more independent and learn to live on themselves.  And also they will take on more responsibility and that is very important when in their later life.  And also, by doing a part-time job, they can step into the society quicker and learn about the rules in the society and yeah, learn about the society itself.  And also they can get some working experience for their future career.  They may get a better job.

I think it is important for students to get a part-time job because first of all, it is the essential problem about the money.  Umm - while students are studying in university, they are already 18 years old or – or elder, so that they have the ability to work and the ability to earn money and support for their family because when they were – we were younger, we had no – no time or the ability to work for but we get the money from the family, so when we have the ability I think that we should – we should – we should use our ability to support our family back.  Another thing is that the experience we can gain from working is...

I agree that it is important for college student to have part-time jobs.  It is because as a college student I don't have class every day, so I have lots of leisure time and I can use the time to earn more money for myself and I am an adult now.  I don't feel like asking my parents for pocket money.  So, I can earn money for what I want to buy or what I want to spend on.  And also by doing part-time jobs like tutoring or working in an office, college students will know what they like to do.  For example, I want to teach in the future.  When I tutor more, I know if I love to teach students and what grade I want to teach in.  So, college students can know what their interest is by doing part-time jobs.

I don't think – I don't agree college students must take up part-time job because I think there are a lot more important things worth doing in these 3 or 4 years, the happiest 4 years in their lives.  For example, if they do not care much about the GPA, they can still use the time – lecture or leisure time to discover what – what they really concern for their lives like finding their own interest and maybe they can take some time to join other societies to – to develop their potential for – apart from academic performance and they can also use the time to – to try different things that is not related to career.  Because they – after they graduate from the college, they may not have much time to do whatever they want.  They have...

These days some people think that it is important for college student to have a part-time job.  To a larger extent, I agree with this statement and I am doing part-time job as well.  As a college student, I think study is not the only thing they should focus on because they – after they graduate they need to work, so working at a previous stage and earning more experience as they could [***], would benefit them more than just reading books, [***] or doing revision and going to lectures.  So, I think real time experience in work place is also very important.  Some people may worry that doing the part-time job would affect their academic result, but I think they are able to have better – they have...

I think it is very important for college students to do part-time for three major reasons.  First is to get exposure and the second would be to gain extra money and the third one would be trying to do something out of their comfort zone.  So, for the first one, to gain more exposure.  Students have been doing their studies throughout their life for around 20 years and they should get to know more about the society and to have bit more exposure other than studying.  And the second reason is that to get more money.  Because I think it is very important for college students to establish the idea of financial management.  So, upon doing part-time and receiving salary, they have to manage the money themselves.  And the third one would be step out of their comfort zone because there is a saying that college students are now not mature enough and not...

I think it is important for college students to have – to have part-time job during their study.  This is because it is essential for them to acquire different job skills before they contribute to the society after graduation.  The job skills that they can acquire can be communication skills when they have to communicate with their boss, to colleagues or to clients.  If they are working in a company, they can also acquire organizational skills when they have to organize events, workshops or conferences for the company.  What is more, taking up a part-time job provide them a chance to further develop...

Basically I agree with the statement because like – for part-time job, they can – college students can earn some money to like – umm – for their daily expenses because studying in the university is not cheap at all.  I am not saying that the money earned from part-time job can like truly pay for their tuition fees, but at least it can lessen the burden, maybe they can buy textbooks and other supplementary aids for their daily usage, so they – so they don't rely too much on their parents' money.  And also by earning, by doing part-time jobs, they can sort of like enter the society a little bit quicker than others because they can have some job experience before they go job hunting after their graduation.  So, it somehow prepares their mindset and they could know what to expect when they...

So, I think it is important for college students to take up a part-time job if they really have the time or [***] to better when they have the ability to strike a better balance between academic study and also the time.  Because I think that as a college student it is important for them to gain more firsthand experiences before they step into the job market because nowadays I think the college students may lack of some really technical skills when they are working in a job field, particular job field especially.  So, on one hand gaining their own experience in that occupation, but on the other hand also, it is important for them to develop a better interpersonal relationship of...

Umm- I - I agree that students should get a part-time job because you never know what your real ability is after unless you get a job.  Because doing a part-time job you will have – you will have a lot of opportunities to explore and what you want to be or what you would like to do in the future and I think this really helps to – helps you to find your interest in pursuing the future studies and after that, I think moreover doing a part-time job, you can earn more money and sometimes doing part-time jobs maybe a bit of time consuming, but as long as you can – you learn how to like balance your time between your studies or your working.  Then, I think it's quite preferable for students to do a part-time job during their studies as long as you are not interested in it too much...

I think nowadays it is important for university students to take part-time job because – umm – gaining valuable job experience is very important to them because when you graduate, the things that your employer will look at is not only your academic results but also whether you have job experience and I think it's also important because when people take part-time job, they will hopefully realize how hard it is to make money, so that they will – umm –  they will save more money and I think taking – taking part-time job is conducive...

I think it is very important for the college students to take part-time job because I think as – as university students there are many different kinds of things that are more important than just learning from school, just like when you are taking up a part-time job, you will try to learn from what you – what you do in your job.  This – this inputs [***] some kind of skills just like interpersonal skills and communications skills.  And these skills can - can't be definitely learned from just learning from your university and I think as a university student, there are many different kinds of things that is more important than just excel academically and as mentioned those skills...

Many people believe that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I agree most of the time because well before graduation it is important that people have some sort of work experiences, so there is something not just to write on their CVs, but also accumulate firsthand experience in actual work settings.  But some people work just to earn money and I don't really subscribe to the idea except if the financial situation of your family it's not that good.  So, it really depends on what kind of job – part-time job that people worked for.  But on average, in most cases, yes I believe that people should be using their time to...

I really think that it is very important to have a part-time job as a college student.  There are several reasons for that.  The first reason is that having a part-time job can help them gain more work experience which can help them to work better in future and they can know more about their interest of different job.  And the second reason is that they can try to learn more about how to cooperate with their colleagues if they have a part-time job as a college student.  Because of the globalization here, in Hong Kong, so most of the companies will hire people from different backgrounds or even different ethnicities, so if they got a part-time job in a very globalized company actually they can learn how to cooperate with their colleagues.  It will be very nice for them.  And the third reason is that they can learn how to cooperate...

I think it is very important for college student to take part in part-time job because first they can earn money to save and to pay for future purposes such as their credit card debts or their daily expenses and most importantly they can pay for the tuition fees and to get less reliant on their family and second of all taking up part-time job can make their CV better than others by gaining more experience in working in the society and from part-time job you can learn human skills and interpersonal skills as well as communication skills.  These kind of techniques cannot learned from – cannot be learned from school, but can only be learned from actual practices in society, for example, taking a part-time job.  I myself have taken part-time job as well.  For example, as a summer intern in the science park and as a summer intern in art...

Actually I have very sensitive position about whether the college students should take a part-time job.  So, one reason is that most of the college students they are busy with their daily school work, which means they will be busy from Monday to Friday and it would – if you want to take a part-time job you basically work for at least 4 days a week, which means it really hard for you to both concentrate on your school work and your part-time job.  But on the other hand taking a part-time job will be also a necessary step for many of the college students before they can enter into the society.  So that will be a dilemma, which means if you want to take a part-time job you will be hardly absolutely concentrate on your school, but if you do not want to have a part-time job it will be really hard in the competition among the society.

Hello, my response for whether university students should have a part-time job is that is no.  The first and major reason is about is that part-time jobs need time and then it will hinder study, students are not treated it properly because a lot of time will be spared to – to focus on a part-time jobs.  Main motives of students of having a part-time job is to earn – to earn extra money or for the maybe leisure, for the entertainment.  However, such kind of activities it's – it is not having a [***] management or the students are to involve in part-time jobs like tutorials, maybe for three – three times a week.

I think it's important to have a part-time job during university life, because university is full of freedom and we can get to choose how to use our time apart from studying.  So, I think having part-time job helps individual to learn how to manage the time, like how to strike a balance between work and academic studies, and apart from learning how to manage one's time by having part-time job during university life I think another – um – benefit of having a part-time job during university life it's also about how – how to cope with – uh – people like in workplace we may have...
Okay.  I think – uh – it is important for students to have a part-time job, because I think – um– university life is not about – uh – it's not about studying only, but it is also about – uh – other things and life experiences, for example – um – you have to apply the knowledge acquired from your – um – uh – courses and textbook in – uh – workplace. So, I think – uh – first I think – uh – for – uh – university students they have time – they have enough time for them to allocate – um – they have some time – for them to allocate sometime to – uh – for part-time job and I think it is affordable because – um – it's not like junior students they have to – uh – prepare for their exams, and also I think they are mature enough to handle – uh – different kinds of job because – um – after all the university prepares them for their...

Um – whether the university students to – should – uh – take the part-time jobs or not I think – um– they should – uh – it is good for them to have part-time jobs.  Um – for me I do part-time job, so – um – for example, they – I help those college students and second year students – uh – to their tutoring.  I – I mean I – I do tutoring for them, and also I teach piano – um.  I think having part-time jobs – uh – for students can – uh– keep abreast – make them keep abreast of their current knowledge, gives – um – many students after high school they may forget about some basic knowledges like mathematics and some grammar or English – um – knowledge – um – after you are specializing yourself to...
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  First of all, college students should be independent from their parents.  They should earn themselves their pocket money, so having a part-time job is a good way to do so. Secondly, they should – um – have the experience of working with others in a workplace, so having a part-time job can equip them with the experience, and – um – it is very – um – like in college you don't have very packed schedule and you often have – um – a few day off, so – um– you will have a lot of free time and to make good use of it is to try something that you have never done before, and – um– you can always – um – try some part-time jobs that you will not have the opportunity to do in the future after graduation.  Like for me I have worked in sta...

I definitely agree that college students should get a part-time job.  The thing is that they should be more financially independent from the family so – because they have the ability to do that.  They can be private tutors and they can already earn themselves money they need for their daily expenses.  The second reason would be it will better prepare them for entering the society.  They would know how is it like to survive in the world of bad out [***], so if they work outside.  And the third reason would be they can try many different jobs to see if they really want to do them when they graduate.  It's like internships of that kind.  So that they won't have – they won't feel so lost or they won't regret upon their choices after they graduate and when they get a real job.  Umm - another reason would be or somewhat or probably they would have a better CV, so that when they look for a job when they graduate, they...

Another thing that I think is very good for college students to get a part-time job is that they will actually know how to [***] to actually earn money because like – I think [***] very lucky that they are usually provided with what they need and what they want.  But it depends.  So, they do not need to work to get anything they want.  So, I think actually going to work can help them to understand how this is – how the society works and how it is difficult to earn to make living.  They will understand that I think and learn to treasure what they have and do not spend – and learn to spend the money wisely.  And another thing that I think is very good that college students have a part-time job is that they can start to build connections because as a college student they – we have a...

I don't think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  There are mainly three reasons.  The first one is that I think part-time job can enrich our horizons in social setting.  We are no longer limited to – to school setting if we have a part-time job and I think it is important for us to enhance our social skills like communicating with other people of our school and this is useful for us to – umm – to work after graduation and suddenly you realize that it is turn for us to earn some money and support our family.  We are now about 20 years old and we should be capable to make some money in order to support ourselves as well as our family and finally the third reasons is that having a part-time job – having a part-time job is good for us because we are old enough to manage our time well and...

I think I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job as most of them are college students, they should be responsible for their own expenses and if they get the part-time job, they will have a chance to improve their life – living standard and also it's plausible for them to arrange their time and spend their time efficiently, like they can study and do a part-time job simultaneously, so they can gain more experiences and face more challenges when they are still young and this will help their future as the experiences can help them to...

Umm – I agree that students should do – I mean college students should have their part-time job during their university time because they can apply what they learned in the universities to their hand out experience – yeah – outside experience.  For example, if you go to the [***] you can have a part-time job of being a tutorial teacher, yeah, so that you can teach.  This is a private [***] [***] and second language [***] and see how they work.  Second, may be you can – because when you are - when you are focusing on your knowledge study in university you may, like know the importance of communicating with the society outside [***] therefore I think it is...

I agree that colleges students should take some part-time job when they are in college because first of all I think this would provide them with some money to support themselves and also – umm – by doing that they can sort of reduce the burden of their family and also they can be more independent by doing a part-time job and learn to share the responsibilities.  I feel it is very important in their later life and they can also step into the society quicker and learn about the society and use the process of step into the society in their later – in the future.  And they can also get some working experience for their future career and then get a [***] job because it's the – umm – part-time job experience in the job field.  And also by doing that, they can learn more about the...

I think it is important for university students to get on a part-time job because of their ability – umm – when the students are studying in primary schools or secondary schools, they don't have that time and the ability to do so, but when they are elder and studying in university, they have the freedom to organize what to do in their free time.  For example, having a gathering with friends or studying or getting a part-time job.  So, when we have a – we have a choice I think that we should get a part-time job.  Moreover, the experience we gain working is invaluable which is something we cannot learn at school.  Just like we can know more about the other peoples from different social background...

It is important for college students to have part-time job because they can earn money for themselves, so they can be responsible for what they want to buy and what stuff they want to spend on.  Moreover, they will know better what their interests are.  For example, for me, I want to teach in the future and I do tutoring as my part-time job.  Therefore, I know if I really love teaching and which grade I would love to teach in, in the future.  So, by doing part-time jobs, you get to earn money and get to know – umm – if what you are doing is what you want to do in future.  And moreover, you can broaden your social circle by doing part-time jobs.  You meet people with different backgrounds and different age.

I don't agree that college students must take part-time jobs because I think in their 20s they have other much more valuable things worth doing rather than, you know, preparing for career life.  I think they can take leisure time to explore their interest, develop their potential, and try more new things that is not related to money or future career life.  They can – they can join societies or – or NGO organizations to – to – to do voluntary work.  They can also for some time to develop relationship, to form maybe to prepare for forming family in a future.  They can also use this time to – to take care of their family and spend time with friends.

College students, particularly those in the higher year, will have more free – free time outside the classroom.  They will have day off and so they can utilize the leisure time to the potential [***].  Also, what they learn in work place is more precious.  For example, how to communicate with other, with the team, and – umm – to work as a team and to handle some – umm – clients and maybe have some meeting.  All these things cannot be learnt in the classroom once again and it – when – I think the employee – the employers would choose those who have more relevant job experience if all – if all candidates are having equal...

In college, doing part-time as a college student is to get exposure.  It's to gain money and try establish the idea of financial management and to get [***].  So, all these three points.  College students can establish compatibility – an ability that cannot be learnt in the college environment.  For example, the interaction with different age group and – umm – the actual experience and living in the society and in reality – in reality.  So, I think having a part-time for a college student is very important and also by experiencing more in the field [***], the students can have a clear picture upon their career planning and about their life goals and it can help...

I think it is important for college students to take up part-time job during the study.  This is because this provides a chance for them to explore their interest and perhaps get to know more about the industry that they wish to participate in after graduation, so that they can have a clearer picture of their career path.  Also, they can acquire different job skills during the – say internship.  The job skills can be organizational skills and communications skills when it is almost a must for them to communicate with their boss, colleagues, or to clients.  They can also develop – develop the organizational skills when they have to organize these...

Basically I agree with this statement because I think that having part-time jobs can not only earn money but it also gives youngsters the chance to experience what the society is like.  Studying in - in university is not cheap at all, so having a part-time – umm – from the salary earned from the part-time jobs, students can like – umm – help with their daily expenses.  I am not saying that the money earned can truly pay for their tuition fees, but at least they can use the small amounts of money to like buy textbooks and other stuff they need on a daily basis, so that they don't need to rely on their parents' money as much as possible.  Also, by working part-time jobs, they can know what it – what it is like to work in society and what's the job...

I think it is good for academic – for college students or university students to take up a part-time job if they have time or if they have the confidence to strike a balance between the academic field and also their time because I think taking – the experience of taking a part-time job as a golden chance for them to better know about the job market and also to better enhance their personal network in terms of interpersonal relationship because nowadays college students are found to have a lack of confidence and also lack of technical knowledge that you should have acquired before you are prepared to be in the job market.  So, it will be a very valuable chance for them to learn a lot while taking a part-time job when they are...

I agree that students should get a part-time jobs for them because I think doing a part-time job can help them to discover more about their abilities and what their interest is.  For example, - umm – if a student really wants to do – wants to become a teacher in the future, then he or she can take up a part-time job in the tutor center or be a private tutor and in this way he or she can have an experience in like teaching other students and so that she – and then they will know whether they really want to be a teacher in the future.  And also doing a part-time job can help them like earn some money and have to ease on their family burden on – in – in pay – in paying their tuition fees.  And also, I think doing a part-time job can help the students to learn how to take up more of their own responsibilities or have better...


Female Interviewee
Nowadays I think taking part-time job is important for the university graduates because gaining valuable job experience is really beneficial to them when they graduate and go out to work because what the employers look at is not only your academic results, but also whether you have enough job experience and I think – umm – taking part-time job is – can widen your horizons as to – umm – what is – what the job market and outside world look like and it also consolidates what you have learnt in school.  It also...

I think it's important for college students to take a part-time job because university is not just learning from your school and instead you can learn more different various skills from your part-time job just like interpersonal skills and communication skills because you can be – you can be – you can working in environment and then you have to adapt to it and you have to perform well in that environment.  And other from this kind of skills that you can learn, it is also very important to gain experience from your job because after graduation you have to have some work experience to keep - to make you capable for your future career, so – so in this sense...

In general, I think that college students should get a part-time job because according to my experience and according to many of my seniors, – umm – part-time jobs offer good opportunity for - umm – college students to gain work experience and that is very important for their future jobs, especially if they want to get a decent one because that's how they stand out among the crowd – umm – and it's also way for them to see what they like and don't like – umm – but of course, it depends on the kind of part-time job people work for.  It's not like [***] work for jobs that get you a lot of money but do not give any work experience, but it also depends on – it depends on your financial situation, so...

I actually think that it is very important to have a part-time job as a college student.  Besides gaining more work experience and trying to learn how to cooperate with people from different ethnicities, I have - the third point is that they can actually learn how to cope with their stress.  I am sure that when you are working, actually you – everybody will be very stressful.  But the point is that the stress from work is actually different from the stress from studies.  So, if they got a part-time job, so they must be able to have a taste of what is the stress from work like and there – I mean there is a fourth point for that is that they can apply what they have learnt from college like maybe – if I was studying in hotel management or education program, actually if you are – I mean having a part-time job as employee in a concierge or...

I think it is very important for college student to take part-time job because of following two reasons.  The first reason is that they can pay for their tuition fee by saving more money in the bank and pick myself as an example I am currently borrowing money from the government and to pay for my tuition fees.  Before graduation I am already in debt of more than 20K and therefore working as the part-time job can make me save money and be more able to pay for the tuition fee and at the same time we are less reliant on my family.

And the second reason is that taking part-time job can enable students to learn more experience before working in society when we graduate because working part-time job we can learn communication skills, interpersonal skills as well as human skills.  These kind of techniques cannot be learned in studying books, but can only be learned in actual practices by working in the...

Actually it is like a dilemma that means on the one hand most of the students that is a full time undergraduate in the university.  They will be basically busy from Monday to Friday, which should make it hardly possible for all of them to get a part-time job which will basically requirements, have a requirement for at least 4 days a week.  But on the other hand taking up part-time job will also be a method or a stat before we get into the university, not the university the college, the society.  That means if you want to concentrate on your sports it will be hard to concentrate on your part-time job, but if you want to have a part-time job it will certainly get in the way of your school work.  Which means if you want to get the both sides get on the both ends you have to create extra attention and spare no effort considering whether you...

Talking about the examples that I would like to draw your attention to one example of my friend is that she – because she need to earn money for her family that she seriously jeopardized her studies.  Yes, we can see that maybe as friends she is emotionally disturbed and then both her mental and physical health is really at risk.  That's why I really strongly do not advise to take a part-time job unless you are – you are seriously in need of money to do things, to support your family or else focus on your studies is the wise choice.

As for the part-time job nature usually – because jobs are different from...

I think having a part-time job is – uh – about learning how to manage our time during university life as we have much freedom in choosing how to use our time, and I think – um – the other benefit of – uh– having a part-time job is not only about the money that we can gain from the job itself, but also – uh – to learn how to work with – work in the real world and what it is like to work with other people, and how to work for other people as we often only get to – um– make presentations with our peers rather than – so in real life working situations we get to deal with various kinds of people, and I think having a part-time job also gives people some experience in the field that which they want to wish to go to, so they can have a taste of...
And after all I think – uh– part-time job is very important for the development of – uh – university students, because they need to learn how to cooperate with other people, and this is not something that can be acquired when a student only goes to college, and studies, and other things, so they need real working experiences. And also, this – I think having a part-time job is – uh – to be honest, is – uh– can be considered as a part that polishes our resume because you know – um – you need to – um – conduct interviews and you need to show your employer in the future that you are a capable person, other than studying you are also – uh – capable and – working with others, and applying the knowledge and other thing – other similar things, and so I think – um...

I think having part-time job for students is good for them, because they – there are many benefits for students having part-time jobs – um – for example, when you do tutoring for primary students or secondary students you can – um – uh – remind yourself about all those basic knowledge – um – of academic stuff just like basic – uh – mathematic skills, and grammars or – uh – English – uh– speaking skills – um – for example – um – moreover like – um – if you do – uh – teaching pianos or do other kinds of part-time jobs in hotels you can try to train your communication skills and teaching skills, and I think – uh – it's time for students to step into the – uh – society by getting a part-time jobs and um...
I agree that it is important for college students to have part-time jobs.  First of all, they should be independent from their parents.  They should not ask their parents for money anymore, so they should have part-time jobs so that they can – um – earn money for themselves to spend. Second of all, they should – um – they should have the experience of working with people in a workplace, so having a part-time job is a really good opportunities for them to experience working with others, and um, thirdly they can try something that they will not have the time to do in the future, like for me I worked as a part-time director at Davos [***] before and it is the job that I will not do after graduation, so – um – I think it is a really good experience to experience it in a young age...
