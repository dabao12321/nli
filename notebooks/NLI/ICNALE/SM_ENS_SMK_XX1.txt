I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in restaurants.  I understand that people have the right to smoke if they want to, but some people really can't that I think maybe they have problems with their body or something, but they really just can't tolerate cigarette smoke especially when they're eating, and I just like I know that a country like Japan have section smoking areas, but I really don't see the point to that.  If you have two people – if you have a people smoking and people not smoking, the smoke is just going to drift over to the nonsmoking section.  So, I don't really understand how that supposed to not affect nonsmokers.  Uhm, anyway, I guess yeah it's fine to smoke if you want, but it sort of inconsiderate to do it in public areas where there is a whole bunch of other people who don't smoke and we prefer that you also don't smoke, but I don't want to say anything to you.  Uh, yeah, smoking is fine to do if you really want to, but if it – it's one of those things that has another – has really strong affects on other people also.  So, I think just people should just con...
Yeah, well, it is a fact that I myself is a – I am a smoker but in terms of, like, smoking at restaurants, yeah, I feel like, yeah, smoking should be banned in restaurants because sometimes like families are bringing their children to restaurants and you don't want like little kids to inhale that second-hand smoke which will cause like bad outcomes in their lives.  Yes.  So yes, so overall, I believe that yes, smoking should be banned in restaurants if you know what I'm saying. Well, some people would agree like – some people would say like, yeah, they want to smoke but I mean you can just smoke outside.  Or maybe they should have like a special area for people to smoke instead of like smoking in a place like where there'll be kids and old aged people.

Do not smoke.  Smoking is bad.  Okay?  Don't do drugs.  Don't go bad.  I don't like smoking but I don't really give two shits if someone does smoke.  I have a lot of friends that smoke.  Whether it should be banned or not?  I don't know.  I guess why not.  Ban it all.  Yes, they deserve to die and I hope they burn in hell. What do you mean I am yelling?  This is my normal voice.  Have you seen any of my movies?  Deep Blue Sea.  The fucking shark ate me.  Samuel Jackson Bear.  It will get you drunk.  You'll be fucking bad chicks in no time.  Hmmm, is there anything else to say on this subject?  Potato chips are good, drink beer, fuck like rabbits.  Just don't reproduce.

Yes, I think that smoking should be banned completely from inside of restaurants because, first off, it's a – it's better for some people to be able to smoke outside and they won't bother others.  The bans are – sometimes the places that they have here in Japan are you can smoke inside.  And if you are not a smoker, you know, the – the fumes and everything bother people around you and is – is less considerate.  However, in America, we have banned – you have the smoking ban from all indoor shops and in restaurants. So – and before it seemed like a problem but they didn't really see that as a problem later on as the law got passed and people stopped doing it.  So, I don't think there will be a problem at all for people to – to continue to – I mean to change – to have that law changed.  I think it actually be a –

I agree that a restaurant – smoking in all restaurants across the country should be banned for one – the first reason is that restaurants are places for eating food and people that don't smoke will definitely be there as well and they would prefer not to have other people's smoke blown in their face.  Two, children could possibly be at some restaurants as well and second-hand smoke has been known to lead to cases of asthma or even cancer.  So, trying to keep away second-hand smoke from everybody is very important, especially people that do not want smoke in their eating area.  Separating from nonsmoking and smoking is still very difficult so you cannot completely get the –

I definitely believe that smoking should be banned in all kind of public places and restaurants simply because it's irresponsible and, frankly, disturbing that the people constantly working there have to breathe second-hand smoke constantly.  As I have grown up, I have watched my grandmother disintegrate into severe emphysema and her lungs regularly collapsed and she spent a lot of time in hospital.  And she had never touched a cigarette in her life but spent 20 years married to a chain smoker.  And this kind of impact is what I am envisaging for the teenagers currently that are working in restaurants and sort of bars in Japan.  I can really see some severe damage happening to young people that are intaking a lot of second-hand smoke because the illusion that breathing it through one set of lungs...

For this one, I don't really care because most restaurants nowadays have a separation of smoking and nonsmoking either – either by a floor or by built – built-in wall or things – separated walls and things like that.  So as far as I am concerned, they can keep on smoking as long as they are in the smoking area.  Another thing to consider is if the restaurant has an open bar, then it becomes all right to smoke in the bar area, but in the actual restaurant not so much.  This is mostly because most of the restaurants I come from have an open bar and usually other things like pool tables and things like that, so smoking is just, kind of, something you have to – you had to live with.  So, as far as I'm concerned I don't care other than that.

I do think that smoking should be banned in restaurants.  As someone who only smokes occasionally, it's really uncomfortable to be in a situation where I am trying to eat and enjoy a meal and all I can smell is cigarette smoke.  I can't even smell my food.  I think that smoking – if someone wants to smoke, that's their prerogative to do so, but I don't think that they should have to – I don't think they should be able to impose that on other people who don't do it. You can go outside or go into a – you know, a smoking room or something without having to force everyone around you to inhale your cigarette smoke.  it's not healthy.  And especially around children and babies, younger people, and really old people, it's not healthy for them to be inhaling all that second-hand smoke.  it's not healthy for anyone to be inhaling it.  it's just as harmful as smoking yourself.  And, you know, I don't want to end up with health problems because I'm inhaling other people's smoke.  That's not really fair.  I think in bars it's different, but I think any establishment that...

I don't agree with the topic.  While – well, although I don't agree that there should be completely banned, I do agree – I do think that there should be some type of regulation as to where people can smoke.  But going back to the topic, I believe that people have the rights to smoke or drink or you know – any – any – anything – any type of vice that they need in other to get by in their everyday life.  I think it's important to allow citizens that freedom.  And, you know, to completely ban something like smoking is a – a bit ridiculous, especially considering – I mean while it's a bit lethal, it's not quite as lethal as some other stuff of which have been banned.  And if we keep taking away – taking away things like smoking or – I mean, let's say, eventually alcohol or any other kind of thing, I mean all we're going to be doing is continually restricting freedoms from people and they won't be as...

Uh, I have many friends who smoke and I don't smoke myself and I do think it is an unhealthy habit or thing to do.  However, I noticed that in a lot of situations in life and with school and the work environment, a lot of my friends who do smoke, it's a way for them to kind of calm down and to reflect and to relax.  On that note, I don't think smoking should be completely banned.  Yes, sometimes the smell of it, it kind of disturbs others and myself at times but other than that I really don't see it as a big thing that should be banned at all.  And in fact I – I really think it's a good thing because they have a – a relaxing factor to it.  Now, I have my own outlets of relaxing, you know, I skate or do other things but I – I am happy to see that whenever my friends are feeling stressed or you know...

I think that smoking should not be banned all over restaurants in the world because I believe that people should have options and I think that is really the freedom for which we strive to live for is having the ability to choose what we want to do and what we want to, I suppose, do to our bodies.  And I understand the fact that certain restaurants might not have a smoking area or not have smoking available at all, but to say that smoking should be banned from every restaurant is very, very demanding – not demanding but in general just kind of one-sided.  And I feel like everything in this world has two sides to and in this case it's almost – it is very rude to kind of – well I guess almost like a dictator...

Personally, I think this question is very confusing, what country is it referring to, it's too vague as far as going into it.  Uh, ban in country in restaurant.  Australia did ban just good reasons for it to it be banned.  Um, smoking is not – it hasn't got the same image that it used to have, smoking is actually very bad for you and other people are very – uh – instead of – if you're smoking you're actually affecting those around you.  It's not just this doesn't affect you these days, um, societies okay if you have a choice in your life, um, it's only doesn't affect or hurt anyone else.  So if you're smoking, you're making a choice which is actually not considerate of other people around you.  If you're trying to at a restaurant and you do not like smoke and someone next to you smoking then that's something that's going to really ruin your mood.  So I believe that every – every – uh, every restaurant and every public place should ban smoking around the world, not just a country.  We need to be looking globally.  Smoking is a waste of money and it's also terrible for your health, it kills you.  People shouldn't be, um...
I think that smoking should be banned from restaurants, um, because second-hand smoke is very dangerous – it's mentioned be very dangerous and dangerous effects on the people around the person who is smoking.  Um, people who go to a restaurant not only don't want to have to deal with that kind of health risk, they're going to that restaurant because they want to eat a meal and they don't want to have to be worried about how is the other customers around them going to affect my health.  Um, it is especially important for restaurants that also cater to children and the people who might, um, not be in the best of health because those are the people who are going to be affected the most by someone who is smoking in the restaurant.  Um, I think although it can be a compromise if patron really want to smoke, there should be a designated area outside away from the door of the restaurant where people can go to smoke if they so choose but that they should not be allowed to smoke while they are inside the restaurant itself, doing so creates more of a hazard for people work...
I think smoking should be banned in the restaurants because it ruins the environment and also it can ruin the taste of the food and you don't know who your customers are, someone might come into your restaurant that has asthma or lung problems already and the smoke will not help them and probably make other customers not want to go there anymore.  Also though on the other hand if you do have a smoking restaurant, then you should a separate area, so you can separate the people who want to smoke and who don't want to smoke.  If it's a bar then it doesn't really matter because those people aren't there for the quality of the food.  If they are there for the quality of meal, then you shouldn't allow smoking inside of your restaurant because it will definitely travel throughout the place and it's hard to clean, hard to get out of the building and it lingers and it will...
I do agree completely.  I think smoking should be made completely illegal everywhere in every country because it is the most damaging and disgusting and uncomfortable habit that people produce it, a terribly terrible drug, it is incredibly bad for you.  And it's not just bad for those people that are smoking, it's bad for everybody around them, the children, uh – uh, the children of smokers.  My mother smoked while I was in the room and I think that's deployable, it's damaging to not only your health but you're also damaging other people's health by smoking near them or smoking near that children or smoking near anyone.  It – you're basically being accomplish murder.  If you're smoking something that gives – know – is known to give people cancer then you're giving yourself and everybody else around you cancer, um, I really hate looking behind somebody who is smoking.  I think that's...
I disagree with people with smoking is bad, but I also agree that everyone has their habits and not everyone related to health.  Basically in this world people need to dedicate to themselves then and forget about the world, because people that smoke they had their decisions and they know that that is a bad habit and they know that they could lead to can – lung cancer.  But people don't understand, so I think that because people – I think that is bad to be smoking in the restaurant, but I also think that meanwhile that the smoker for 10 feet [***] or is in the restaurant, they could smoke the cigarette and – and there won't be a problem.  I also think that everyone should have the opportunity to do what they want to do, not what others say.  So if they want to smoke outside of the restaurant, should be free or if in the restaurant they could smoke and they want to smoke in the restaurant, they can't smoke in the re...
I'll be honest I didn't quite understand where the place was that it was being banned, um, it – it – it wasn't said very clearly.  Um, but again, um, I'll just generally speak about smoking, smoking ban as a whole.  Um, I think that designated areas, they provide comfort and relief for individuals but can't smoke but then I think that there is no – not in the first place and again your ostraciz – the amount of ostracizing people and almost I don't know, designating – taking away their freedom of being able to do something so, um, in – in essence I do believe that, um, while smoking is harmful and it is harmful to individuals around, um, around us, we should, um, make – we shouldn't just ostracize them to a single zone, we should make arrangements to not only comfort those who do not smoke but also those that do smoke, so again...
Okay.  Um, I partially agree, disagree, um, I do think, um, smoking should be banned in public spaces and places like that other people will be affected by smokers because smoke is very bad in that way not – not only for the person that's smoking but for other people that surround that, say, you know, the children sat around on a sidewalk with them that we never know they could have asthma or some other, you know, health – health – health problems that will be affected by smoking.  However, I don't think it should be totally banned upright because this is – well, people should be able to do what they want, um, and you know – you know, it was rather tactically not a drug but they are addictive so that it's hard to, you know, to be – but I think people still be able to choose what they want to do to their bodies...
I think that smoking should be banned in all places in the country.  The only places of smoking should still be allowed; it is in one's household.  And I also think that they should ban smoking around children.  I think that any public place whether it be a parking lot or a store lot or especially implied they should not have any place for them to be smoking.  It fills with air pollution and it's very, very unhealthy for everyone walking by.  Second-hand smoke is worse than the smoke that this first-hand smoker is filling into their bodies and no one wants to deal with, the cancer and all the other bad effects that come from smoking.  On top of that, it smells very bad.  It [***] unless someone with their own private property where they [***] escaping into other people's property, that's the only time that they should be allowed to smoke.
So, in America, smoking has already been banned in many public places such as restaurants and I strongly agree with that.  I think, um, be – breathing second-hand smoke is extremely dangerous and I would like to be and even greater ban on smoking in public places.  However, I think to completely ban smoking and make it entirely, um, illegal as a nation will not make sense, particularly because when the government starts restricting people's right, more and more – um, well, sometimes they don't know when to stop and you end up losing constitutional freedom, um, that the government was never meant to have a stay over because people do have freedom of choice and freedom of will and today's science told us what smoking does to someone's lungs, um, but that's...
Yes, I do believe that smoking should be banned in the country throughout all of it.  First of all, it is very unhealthy for human to smoke, it can cause death in the womb if a mother is smoking and she is pregnant.  Um, it can also cause a lot of litter in general just in the community because a lot of people who smoke just throw the cigarette  --  cigarette on the floor.  Um, but it is also bad for people who might have asthma or health problems where they struggle breathing, especially second-hand smoke.  The people who smoke themselves actually end up affecting a lot of others who are breathing in the same air that they are letting out.  Nicotine in general is very bad for it.  It can cause lung cancer and there -- 
Whether or not the smoking should be banned in restaurants is an interesting question simply because in the UK this is already in law, it's relatively recent law, say, in the last 5, 10 years perhaps.  But it also something that's been happening and increasing with smoking in public areas is inc – is seen as non-popular thing.  Whether people should be allowed in restaurants – smoking in restaurants, I don't think so.  Smoking is a very personalized habit.  It comes with lots of odors.  It comes with lots of negative health effects that people are aware of but used to ignore.  And it's not a pleasant environment for everybody and then when you're in a restaurant, you're in a public environment that's why you should be able to respect the individual, as well as yourself, not means making accommodations to, um, be flexible in both directions.  If you're comfortable at home taking your shoes off, then it's fine to take your shoes off, but if you want to be comfortable outside, you just relax again...
Because smoking is allowed in the United States and because it is sold in almost every convenient store, cigarettes and pipe tobacco, I don't believe that it's reasonable to ban it in every public place.  However, I do agree with the idea that smoking should be removed away from the non-smoking public.  There should be designated areas for people who choose to smoke, can do so, however it should be completely removed from people who wish not to be around the house of smoke.  In turn, cigarettes or other harmful tobaccos are banned completely from sales, I don't think that it is okay to ban it from public.  It doesn't make sense.  If they want to spend your money on cigarette and they want to smoke...
I think that smoking should be banned.  It is a poor health choice with money, poor health public hazard and I think that for every individual the consequences are bad.  And I think that it would be wise to ban smoking, not only in the pubs with individuals taking part in smoking but it  --  also second-hand smoking have harm those who choose not to smoke themselves.  Second-hand smoking can also be just as dangerous and lethal as an individual smoking himself.  I think that it is, um, not a good idea to force others to partake in this activity which they have chosen not to partake in themselves.  And I think that smoking should be banned and I think that it is unhealthy and that it would be a wise choice -- 
I do agree that smoking should be banned from all restaurants because, first of all, if someone wants to smoke I believe that they should smoke on their own time and for a restaurant to open that, you know, their home – well, not their home, but their business and in fact that it probably won't just be a smoking-only restaurant, they should be considered [***] to other people who do not want to make the side effects of smoking because second-hand smoking is bad of course to be worse than first-hand smoking.  And then on top of that, I know some restaurants segregate between like, oh, there is this smoking area and that there is non-smoking area although that is helpful, it's still to the point that if you do want to take smoke, you can easily step outside and take up smoke because there again it's [***] want to be courteous to other people who do not want that in their environment at all who is not paying to smell smoking at all.  And I can say this because my mother is a really big smoke...
I agree that restaurants should ban smoking because of the second – second-hand smoking and ever third-hand smoking.  And also it's not good for you and your taste buds will go down I heard and for me as a non – non-smoker it kind of gets irritating when people are on their phone or like smoking and getting preoccupied where we are trying to have a conversation with wife.  So that is why I agree that all restaurants and bars should ban smoking.  There should be a smoking bar for the smokers to actually have an area to smoke.  So that – I think that's under the alternative instead of smoking in the restaurant where people are eating and also the cause of health issues too, so I agree that restaurants and bars should ban smoking and instead enjoy your meal and enjoy your drinks.  And what else?  Another rea...
Yes, definitely this – uh, smoking should be banned because, one, it affects health reasons – where it affects health.  Two, it – it's just bad for the environment.  And three, it – it affects the people around you.  Uh, once again, it affects your own house and especially in a restaurant environment, um, it just – it affects your – the way it either affects your heart or especially affects your lungs and it will cause you to live a less and to, um, it's bad for the – it's bad for the restaurant environment, you know, which – we're trying to eat, we're trying to enjoy the smell and the – as aroma of the restaurant and you know what, you're over here and our people are – are – are smoking and that really – it just have a bad odor and just unprofessional, no-class [***] smell, it could be, you know, it could be reserved for somewhere else outside or and probably see if your own home.  And number three, it affects other people's health because that smoke can get into their lungs and into their, you know, into their food or into their, you know, what...
I do not agree that smoking should be made illegal.  Yes, it is harmful but to decide that it is illegal for all people would have horrible repercussion.  A similar example in history was the prohibition.  The 18th Amendment tried to take away the right to drink any kind of alcohol.  It didn't work because although it is harmful to your health, it is not necessarily harmful to everyone together.  Smoking is a personal private thing and to ban that would infringe on someone's personal decision.  Yes, there should be precautions taken so that it's not affecting other people, but it's not their decision to smoke.  But you cannot hold someone, gNo, you can't smoke.h
Yes, I think smoking should be banned anywhere, however, restaurant conditions will have to be met.  With smoking, however, it is actually proven, second-hand smoke now make to affects on people around you, as well as it's smelling.  Now, I am all – all for people, you know, doing whatever you want, freedom and all that but with smoking have negative impacts to those around you.  I think it's equivalent [***], right, it should be outright banned.  However, I am not a smoker so I suppose it's easy for me to say that.  And I do know it brings the taxes, a lot – bring a lot of money to the country, so smoking wants to be banned I think a substitute would – need to be implemented to bring in the actual money which I think could be an opportunity to legalization of marijuana but yes I definitely think it should be banned.  And also second-hand smoke is bad for your health, I mean, I don't smoke but [***] some kind of smoking related problem despite being only second-hand smoker...
I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned from restaurants for health reasons and for being considerate to others.  In a restaurant, it is normal that it'd be expected that you would be there to eat, and not against anybody who does smoke but first for the general comfort of those around the person, a smoker should be considerate of those around him and refrain from smoking in a public area where there are lots of people who are there to enjoy a meal.  Not only for considerate of other  --  consideration of others but for health reasons.  Some people have respiratory problems and inhaling the smoke can cause severe respiratory problem to person and make them feel bad.  It goes along with consideration of others if -- 
Well, I don't think smoking should be banned because, you know, it's a simple drug.  It's – it's – it's – it shouldn't – it should be everyone's own decision if someone smokes or not.  So it shouldn't be like prohibited.  I think also that weed should legal because it's just a plant which grows in the planet so everyone should be able to make their own decisions.  We shouldn't do the decisions for – for – we shouldn't – shouldn't make decision for someone else.  It's – everyone should be able to do their own decisions and it's not nice if someone smokes in the street, so maybe this should be banned.  I think it is right to me, I think it's....
I believe that smoking should not be outlawed.  If smoking was outlawed it would only make more younger and impressionable children trying to smoking.  I have one friend who smokes and he does it because he believes that it is cool, but other people sees this and knowing the health hazard that they are not drawn to it.  Back in the, uh, mid-1900 alcohol was outlawed in America but this only drove up the demand for alcohol.  I believe that if smoking is outlawed, it would be the same situation that smoking would be considered a very rebellious act and it would be more appealing to younger and fashionable kids.  I believe that we need to make the health risks of smoking more widely known.
I believe that the issue of smoking in public restaurants is perhaps a vital issue.  Um, first of all, I would say that to be charged that they should be banned, um, you know, not really across the country, uh.  Why and who would be banning?  Uh, smoking in every restaurant, if you should say that maybe a restaurant should do that, then I would agree that if a restaurant owner thinks it's bad for his customers that he should ban it.  If – I believe if you were to ask should the government ban smoking in all restaurants, I would say no, um, because I don't believe that's an area that government is responsible for.  Um, I believe that in personal issues then I believe that restaurants – the restaurant owner should make that decision for themselves, um, and consumers also make that decision, um, whether they want to go to a restaurant, they...
Yes, smoking should be banned everywhere because of the dangerous of second-hand smoke and littering, people throw away their cigarettes on the ground and in plants and places where the toxics – that the toxic element of cigarette can affect the health of many.  Children are also nearby and families and people who don't smoke are all affected by the second-hand smoke.  There is no benefit to it.  It costs a lot of money and – and the medical bills that are necessary to pay for the damages of smoking and – and the way that buildings are yellowed and the smoke damages things, it is not necessary for people to be smoke in public.  You can do that in your house, and ruin your own life but do not affect everybody else in public that does not wish to live that lifestyle.  It is important to ban it and ban cigarette smoking in public so that we can all live healthier lifestyles and not be affected by other people's poor choices and...
I agree.  I think smoking should be illegal mainly because it's really bad for your health and for the people's health around you as well because smoking – when you're smoking it doesn't just affect you, it affects all the people around you due to second-hand smoke.  And there has been no studies that shows smoking is in anyway good for your health, there is no benefits of smoking.  It's just a bad addiction that people get into much like drinking alcohol or they – at least that's they – it's kind of a bit different.  But anyway I think it's a bad kind of habit that people develop and no one stops smoking so if people just didn't – couldn't smoke because of the legal in the first place everyone would be much better off for it.  It's – there will be less chance of lung cancer and also they wouldn't have to like and waste all their money on the expense of cigarettes.  I work in Saint Bridge, and so many people come in and spending so much money on cigarettes every day.  Well, it's really not good, so I think all around society is much better for people not to be smoking, so I think it should be illegal.
Smoking should be banned because it is dangerous for people; it is dangerous for the environment and it – as it's also disruptive.  First, it is dangerous for people.  It's dangerous for people because the – the smoke that they're inhaling is not healthy.  It causes – it's proven to cause problems such as lung cancer, but not only in the people smoking but also in the people that are around them and inhaling the second-hand smoke.  It is said that second-hand smoke is deadlier than a first-hand smoke.  Not only is it dangerous for the people, it is dangerous for the environment.  The smoke that is produced from – from smoking is bad for plants, trees and other living organisms that are around.  Not only that if people aren't responsible all the throwing away the cigarette butts, it also is damaging to the environment leaving those around.  Thirdly, it is harmful to other people.  It's not...
I do agree that smoking should be banned throughout the country because of two prime – primary reasons.  The first thing that it is harmful to the smoker itself and the second is that it is harmful to surrounding people around the smoker.  The reason that smoking is bad for the smoker himself is because there are many carcinogens in the cigarettes that can cause cancer.  Cancers that can be caused are include – include lung cancer, mouth cancer and other cancers as well.  Um, there are other options available including they being – there is marijuana.  There is also other things that someone can do and this is not going very well.  Um, I did not prepare...
Thank you very much once again for your question.  Um, in my own opinion and understanding, I think, um, smoking should be totally banned in most countries, in every country, which is I think smoking is just a habit that's one form by themselves and then it's really, really not good for your health.  Even on the carton of the cigarette, it is written that people who smoke their life are really shorter.  So, I think it's good for government to like ban cigarette even in restaurants – every country.  I think it's not really a good thing.  So, um, I think it's good.  It's just good to ban this in from my own understanding and opinion, like, it's not really good and the upcoming generation are trying to emulate other people by smoking by like a extending the number of peo...
I think smoking should be banned.  There is no benefit whatsoever and it's very harmful to your health.  People that smoked, they – they are addicted to it.  So it's a problem because they can't stop but if you ban smoking, they wouldn't really have access to that as much.  And smoking doesn't just affect the person that's smoking, it affects everyone around who has the smell – smell and breath it in and it's bad for everyone.  So, if you want to smoke, it should be definitely banned in public because it's affecting people that don't want to be affected by it.  If you want to on your ownself, you can do it in your home, but it would be better just ban it overall, that way no one could smoke.  Of course, people that want to would probably still smoke anyway because they will find a way to do it but it would cut it off from general public and probably that stop a lot of people from even starting smoking if they would really want.
I do believe it is important for smoking to be banned everywhere because, one, those who have asthma may have a real bad asthma attack due to the smoke inhalation from those who are smoking.  Two, smoking, don't really appreciate people who smoke around their children because it may cause them to choke really bad, especially around infant that could cause them to have some kind of effect later on in the future.  That also leads cancer, even to those who don't even know smoke could develop lung – lung cancer whi – while breathing in that – um, such strong smoke inhalation.  Third, it's badly addicting.  It's like a drug, it's – it's really bad and I realized some people have various inputs – opinions that smoking is bad for your health and not only affect those who...
Personally, I do not smoke and I do not agree with why another person would want to smoke, but I do not agree with the fact that smoking should be banned completely from all the public spaces.  I understand that it is a personal preference and that if a person, uh, would like to smoke out in public that there should be de – designated, um, area for smoking.  Um, but I feel like that there needs to be a distinct difference between as – uh, non-smoking and smoking area.  Just because I am walking down the road or I am sitting in a restaurant, I do not want to smell someone else's smoking, so I feel like it needs to be an enclosed area where it does not affect someone who does not want to be, um, smelling the smoke, uh, smells or...
Yes, I do believe that smoking should be banned.  Um, first of all, the most important reason I – reason I believe this is because I am a Christian and so if there is a Christian, um, your body is the temple of the holy Ghost.  And, um, it has been scientifically proven that smoking can very significantly damage your lungs and other parts of your body and, um, I believe that this is, um, uh, dere – derogatory to our body and it's very, um, shameful for a Christian to do it because the Bible is completely against it.  Um, even though it doesn't directly say do not smoke.  Um, it is also scientifically proven that people will die faster because they smoked and obviously this is not a – a positive thing.  Um, also smoking will kill brain cell and it can – can hurt your body in other ways so if a student is studying obviously smoking would be very...
I believe that smoking should be banned in public place because of the health hazard posed to the smokers and to those around the smokers.  Nowadays, many people have situations and health concerns such as asthma and other situations where smoke is not healthy for them.  So, first, it should be banned for the safety of those who cannot or should not be around smoke, such as those with asthma and other respiratory problem.  So, if it's banned then no one will have to worry about having an asthma attack or being around smoke that cause them to have reactions and health concerns.  Also, it's banned for second-hand smoker because many of them do not realize what its health hazards are of smoking.  And if it's banned they cannot get involved with smoking, even though they feel pressure may have them do it or, um, feel pressure or other reason...
I believe it would be wise for our leaders in our country to ban smoking in Ireland because it is unhealthy for one, it has profits of nothing, all it does it cause more and more health issues.  And the one of those reasons, the main reason for this, um, banning I believe would be that, um, the Bible says that it will be wrong because in first Corinthians 6:15 says, “Know you not that your bodies are members of Christ?  Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of – of an harlot? God forbid.”  “What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not given your own?  I think as long God need our bodies and that they are not meant to be harmed by us.  We are not meant to do things such as that.  We have to keep Corinthians especially as Christians – as Christian we also are [***]...
So, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  As far as I can remember, I don't think it is something that's even allowed in public places in the United States anymore.  It might be wrong.  Maybe, it's done by State, but I can't remember the last time that I've walked into a restaurant where they asked me if I want smoking or a non-smoking section.  So I think it is an important to not have smoking in a confined space, especially because there is ventilation problem and – in a smaller area that's closed in and Europeans can – uh, also go over to somebody else that might have health problems, what if they have lung cancer already or something like that and their immune system can't handle, uh, can't handle other fumes and so, um, I am pretty sure that's why it would already be banned and...
Yes, I believe smoking should be banned from restaurants because for one, it's unhealthy for the person who is smoking and it adds a lot of health risks at any age and that when people are smoking in public, it can be a bad example to their immediate family but also family around them.  It can teach them that it's, uh, okay and should be accepted to be able to, uh, destroy your temple.  And I also, um, believe that it can be harmful to people that are around them.  There are a lot of people who are very sensitive to smoke and smell that would, um, be produced by cigarette or other smoking devices and I believe that that can inhibit, um, the health – hinder the health, um, of the people around them so that it will be impossible for them to go to the restaurant and that it will be uncomfortable for them to go out in public because all around them is smoke and it can be so sensitive that they will not, um, be participating at the...
Yes, I think that smoking should be banned.  It's not only not good for the person smoking but it is also extremely bad for the person around them.  Um, whenever you have smoke obviously it has damaging effects on people.  It also has damaging effects on buildings and materials and, um, that contaminate things.  Smoking creates more of a mess.  Um, I think smoking should be banned because a lot of times whenever you're smoking, it's not good for you and it's not good for the people around you.  Um, smoking is a very bad habit.  Definitely it should not be done in restaurants, around children, um, or elderly people.  Um, if you are smoking, you are not supposed to be by somebody with oxygen tank and I think it would be very bad, um, and it...
No, I do not believe that it should be – uh, smoking should be banned from – I couldn't quite understand the whole question.  I couldn't understand the words.  I don't think it should be – the right to smoking should be taken away from the individual that is – because I believe that person who is old enough to smoke should be able to have the wisdom or have the ability to choose whether it is right for themselves based on law.  And however, I do believe that they should be courteous of other people and if it affects another person tell that they should not smoke in the presence of another person but if – it this should be, uh, respectful.  Um, to have – to ban something from a person, it's just – unless it is absolutely harmful for...
I believe that smoking should be banned within restaurants across the country simply because of the health reasons so they can have – have an effect on some people.  A lot of people who go out to eat may have problems with breathing, they could be asthmatic and they want to go out to enjoy a nice meal; however, if someone in that building is smoking a cigarette, that smoke will cause them to have a very unpleasant time because they won't actually be able to breathe.  Um, I do think that smoking is a personal choice.  I don't think that it should be made illegal, although I do think that it far – it's far more harmful than it is beneficial for anything, but once again it's a personal choice.  However, in these establishments, it should not be allowed because it is detrimental not only to yourself but to people around you.  You have to be conscious of the people who are coming into the establishment, um, you have to be conscious of the food that...
...not smoke and, you know, we can't really control people in their action because if you ban smoking, even then people can still go and smoke.  It's a choice everybody has to make by themselves.  It's – it's like gun control, you know, if you ban guns that doesn't really, um, correct the problem, make it better because anybody can choose to get a gun still and use it, and those who don't have a gun, you know, it's their choice not to use it but then they are in danger.  But smoking, um, you know it's toxic, as you go to restaurants and these restaurants where there are smoking places and then some spots where you're not allowed to smoke, so it's kinda [***] there and nobody really likes – people don't – not a lot of people – I don't know about that but people don't like smoking, you can go to a restaurant, you can go to a non-smoking area and the people who like smoking go to a...
I agree that smoking shouldn't be allowed in restaurants.  I think – now that I think about it, I don't even see the point of smoking during a meal because you need one hand to smoke and then your mouth is occupied.  But, if you're supposed to be eating then, what – how this – how do you, maybe you take a breaks when you smoke or whatever, but it – I'd really don't see the effects and this and that.  But anyway, uh, yeah you can smoke if you want, but it just think about how other people are affected especially in restaurants where people go to eat food and I don't think it's really a conducive environment to have like smoking people on area and if especially like a restaurant where people bring their children, I don't know if they want to have their children exposed to people smoking.  Uh, smoking in restaurants isn't actually allowed in America, it hasn't been allowed for quite a while, at least, yeah, few decades.  So and I think that's also help to reduce the number of smokers because people want to enjoy their lives with...
Yeah, like I said previously, basically smoking should be banned at restaurants.  I think they should have like a specific area for people to smoke and the reason why smoking should be banned is because like the little children can inhale like second-hand smoke and it's not really fair to them.  So I think it's best like people should either go outside or go to a special area that allows them to smoke.  Peace. [***] Hello?  Nobody talking. [***] Okay.

This is me talking about the subject that you asked me on this recording that I don't really give two craps about because it is a pointless subject.  I will say that if you want to ban smoking, go ahead and ban smoking.  If you don't want to ban smoking, then don't ban smoking.  We don't really give two shits one way or the other.  People are going to smoke regardless if you say to or not to do.  This is human nature.  This is what people do and this is why nobody gives a fuck, so pretty much fuck this this because it doesn't really matter. Now, I'm just going to move on and change the subject because it is just pointless talking about this and there is not much to say on it.  So, yeah.  Now, I am talking about sitting here on this bench looking like Forrest Gump in a park while listening to this stupid survey.  I am looking at the people that are talking and they seem to be enjoying themselves.  But I am not.  I have a feeling that the person that is going to listen to this is not going to enjoy themselves either, but have fun with that because there won't be me.  Sucks to be you buddy, hope you kick yourself in the balls for this.  As far as other thing goes, throw yourself up the stairs, not down.  We don't do down, that's too main...

I think that it would be a good position for people not to start – start smoking inside a restaurant because of the fact that it will bother other people.  And also the people that are around them won't be bothered at the same time.  And then smokers at the other end will have and will be able to have a – if – and they might be bothered by them at the beginning but the fact is that like we can't – we have to look at the majority of the people and the majority of people that don't smoke don't want to – don't want to be bothered by other smokers.  They say that it doesn't bother them but, however, this will get into their clothes.  And also I guess inside the restaurant – inside the restaurants, they have other – like they have to worry about the cleaning and the smell and deodorizing their restaurant.  It would save their money and also at the same time, improve – I mean the money that they save can probably possibly go more to their capital.  The – and also the things that they have to use to be able to – to take away to smoke would be – it'd be you don't have...

I believe that smoking in restaurants across the – it should be banned from all restaurants across the country because smoking – second-hand smoke is very dangerous to people around you.  Even if you are unknowingly near second-hand smoke, there can be damages like cancer or asthma and are even higher chances of occurring in children. Just because you can smoke does not mean you should smoke everywhere around other people and trying to separate smoking and nonsmoking would not be effective because there is still smoke that can seep or go through to the other side and still affect people as well as alienate your customers that have to sit separately and...

I definitely believe that smoking should be banned in, like, restaurants and sort of most public establishments simply because the way that smoking impacts the people that spend a lot of time at establishments such as workers and regular patrons that it can cause a lot of damage to these people.  I've watched my grandmother fall apart.  Her lungs regularly deflate and she had spent so much time in hospital but had never touched a cigarette in her life, yet spent 20 years married to a chain-smoker.  And unfortunately, this is the reason that she has emphysema now and I envisage this kind of future for a lot of the young people working in Japan in bars and then go to restaurants and I think it's a really dangerous situation that there are very few places that young people in Japan and older people as well can actually...

Once again, from my point, I don't really care but this is mostly because when I was a kid, everyone in my family smoked.  My grandma smoked, my aunt smoked, my uncle smoked.  I think the only people who didn't smoke were my mom and my dad.  Anyway, so I was always used to smoking so it, once again, is kind of based on your own personal experience and things like that.  But for me, I – I don't think it's that big a deal.  You can get used to it.  They say second-hand smoke is going to kill you faster than smoking.  But you know what [***]. We are all going to die in the end.  So I have to look forward.  [***] pound steak or a 40 ounce steak, rib eyes, [***], pulled pork sandwich.  I miss barbecue.  It was – it's an amazing thing.  It really is and – and I...

I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants because it's unhealthy for the people who aren't smoking to have to inhale second-hand smoke while they are trying to enjoy their meal.  I think that if people want to smoke, that's okay, but they should do so in a designated smoking room or outside of the restaurant where they are not inflicting their smoke on other people in a closed environment.  Restaurants that smell like smoke aren't really that appealing.  Especially if you don't smoke, it's all you can smell is smoke in the air.  I can't even – when I go in somewhere like a ramen shop that everyone smokes and I can't even smell the delicious food.  I can only smell cigarette smoke and that doesn't really make me want to eat.  The only time I smoke is when I'm not eating, so those aren't really compatible in my mind and it's not healthy for other people to have to inhale second-hand smoke.  it's really dangerous and bad for your health and it can cause people lots of health problems and there are old people and children who shouldn't be inhaling that and having other people impose their habit on...
I agree because, I mean, typically you are only at a restaurant for maybe an hour at the most and I think pretty much everyone can resist smoking for an hour.  Also there are – there are harmful effects on people around you if you are a smoker.  Again, smoking causes lung cancer, I think, I don't know.  Also, it's generally annoying.  Some people don't like the smell, like myself.  Also, the smell that it leaves on your clothing is pretty disgusting.  So I mean just to be considerate, I think maybe smoking in restaurants should be prohibited.  I mean it's not like patrons can't step outside also and smoke – I don't know – like a designated smoking area I'm sure would exist if there were some type of ban on smoking.  Also, they could just not go to the restaurant in the first place if they feel a need to smoke all the time.  They can order out.

I think that's really simple as smoking should be just separated.  You know, just have a smoking section and a nonsmoking section because I – I can – I can understand smoke – the smell of smoke disturbs others.  But like I stated in my previous response that smoking is a way for people to relax.  So I'm pretty sure people will like to smoke and eat at the same time.  Yeah, if anything, just I'm sure restaurants can easily just have an area for smoking and nonsmoking.  It can just be as simple as that.  But it's all up to the company's decision.  If they don't want to have smokers inside of it, you know, I am sure smokers can just smoke right before they go into the restaurant.  And if there's a restaurant that's for smokers only, or I guess people who don't smoke just have to get used to it.

Smoking should definitely not be banned from all restaurants but I understand the issue that smoking presents being a danger and the fact that second-hand smoke is also harmful for those around you, but to the same extent [***] damage to you as well with exhausts.  And, you know, even a cartoon like ‘Winnie the Pooh' could have bad effects on you.  You never – you never really know.  And I think as long as the smokers are just respectable about how they smoke and not really blow smoke on people's [***] I think that you will always need to have options available and there's always going to be people [***] technology and are advancing us and our civilization towards...

I agree with the statement, however, it's very vague.  It should have it – um, all – whether what country you are referring to.  But in Australia it is banned in restaurants.  There are many reasons for that, health risks, um, involved with food, uh, it's also very disgusting when you think about it.  Uh, these days the society, if you make a choice it's okay, if it doesn't affect other people and you are allowed to make that choice.  Uh, if it's something that's going to put other people in danger that it's not accepted by society, smoking doesn't have the same image as it used to have.  It is now considered something that is very bad for you and, um, hazardous to people with health risks especially, not just your health but those around you, so you've got, um, second-hand smoking, think about children in restaurants, they don't want to be breathing in someone else's take – second-hand smoke.  You're affecting other people around you, uh, it's really disgusting and I think the smell, um, of smoking is something that should not be mixed with food, that is disgusting.  It is something that just need to be put away, uh, from food areas.  I believe that keeping smoking away from not only the restaurants but public area...
I feel that all restaurants should ban smoking inside the restaurant.  It's very unhealthy for the other people who come to the restaurant, people who are trying to go and eat, don't want to have to worry about how their health going to be affected because of someone else's smoking in the restaurant.  Um, this is especially important for people who might not have the very best of health, that people who are pregnant or small children, uh, second-hand smokers going to affect them the worse, and they do not need to be exposed to that.  Um, if people do want to smoke when they go to a restaurant, maybe the restaurant could compromise and have the space away from the door where people could go if they still desire to smoke.  But I do not feel that they should be allowed to smoke inside the restaurant at all.  I also feel that, um, there shouldn't be any smoking in the restaurant itself because of the unsanitary conditions that it causes.  Um, the smoke from the tobacco gets into everything; it gets into the carpet, the walls, the boots, the chairs, the smell lingers and it stays there...
Smoking shouldn't be allowed in restaurants because it ruins the quality of the environment, the quality of customers and the quality of the food that you are serving.  The smoke will get into the food.  The smoke will get into the air, smoke will get into the – the seats and it will stay and it will linger and it will push your customers away if – and especially if people have asthma, then you won't be able to go to your restaurant.  And if you do have a smoking area, then it should be separated from other people but also smoking shouldn't be allowed because it allows for more wholesome environment especially for younger children and you don't want children to be around smoke, and smoke will also cause lung cancer, especially second-hand smoke is not good for other people.
Yeah, and I hate walking behind people smoking and fresh air, let alone in restaurants while you're stuck near all of the garbage smoke.  It gets in your head.  It makes your cloth stink.  It ruins your experiences of the food.  It makes you cough and [***] entire time.  People who smoke in restaurants, I don't know if they realize that the – the smoking actually inhibits the sense of smell and taste so they are not enjoying the food as much.  I can't enjoy the food as much because I am also inhibited by their smoking.  Um, smoking areas do nothing to keep the smoke in, um, most of them are completely open and when you – even if they are shut off when you open the door, there are still a draft [***] of smoke that comes out.  Those people that have been smoking, all of their clothes and hand are stink.  So generally just get stuck in a room of smoke that's going to give you cancer or it's going to give you breathing problems or it's going to damage you somehow...
I think – I think everyone – I think everyone should not be smoking in the restaurants, but I also think that everyone should be doing that by trying to smoke 15 feet away from the restaurant.  If you want to smoke in front of the restaurant, they can't do that, but they could smoke like 15 feet away from the restaurant and that is legal.  So, I think everyone should be given the opportunity to smoke 15 feet away from the restaurant but not in the restaurant.  There is – there is some reasons why because many people are asthmatic and they go to restaurants say with the family and they are asthmatic and many people don't understand that.  So the smoke from second-hand or first-hand, it could be inhaled by a person asthmatic and they can have asthma attack.  Many people suffer from heart disease so many people that smoke it's second-hand or first-hand, they go to restaurants and people that have heart disease they could smell the smoke and – and that will bring complications in their life.
Um, so it was restaurant ban, now I understand.  Um, basically I do believe that, um, smoking shouldn't be banned in restaurants and this is coming from a non-smoker because a person should be able to go, enjoy a meal and have a – a cigarette.  I don't think that the area should be adjacent to each other.  I believe that they should – there should be a separation between them and you know, just as we've had in the past, designated smoking areas, and non-smoking areas.  Um – yeah, um, I think it is – again it's a – it's freedom for an individual to be able to do what they want, but then again some may argue that, okay well, if I can smoke – um, cigarettes in restaurant why can't I smoke marijuana or some form – form of Class A drug but, um, again cigarettes – again more within our normative expectations of what individuals might do.  So, I do believe that, um, smoking...
So, I definitely think, um, smoking should be banned in the restaurants.  It's fact that there is other people in the restaurants that, you know, they don't want to be [***] effects that smoking can, um, and I think people who smoke should be aware that it doesn't – not only does it affect them, but it affects the people around them, you know, it's – you know, time and time again it has been proven that, you know, smoking has been significant affect [***], you know, which are people that will be in these restaurants and, you know, it's kind of unfair to for them, they already live in, you know, [***] society and now they have to be next to someone that's smoking and that's unsafe so that certainly I think smoking should be banned in the restaurants.  It's kind of ridiculous to me that that would be – someone would actually want to be...
I think that smoking is very, very bad and should be banned from all public places.  I think that no one should have to smell what the people are sending out when they do smoke.  If someone smokes it's very – very, very bad for everyone around because allergy carcinogens inside of the tobacco and nicotine are getting into everyone else's lung and it causes cancer and also, um, different coughing problems if one dealing with it that people should not have to deal with unless they are actually smoking.  I think smoking is very bad, um, although it should be up to whoever is a smoker, if they would rather smoke or not, um, that's fine.  But as far as people who are not smoking, they should not have to deal with it.  So, people should only be allowed to smoke in their homes and personal vehicles where other people cannot smell it.  It's very, very bad smell and a very, very unhealthy process especially for children.
I absolutely agree with smoking should be banned in all restaurants, I think.  Uh, it's dangerous for people to breathing second-hand – second-hand smoke, it's not pleasant if you walk into a restaurant and there is a lot of people smoking.  Um, if someone needs to smoke, they can step outside and they can do it, uh, in the privacy of their own home, that's their choice, that's their decision.  Um, but as far as very, very public places such as restaurants, um, in my mind that doesn't make any sense.  Um, it's bad for obviously the person smoking but that's their choice, but they are affecting people that are around them in a negative way by smoking, and I think it also, um, harms a restaurant because that means that restaurant is catering to a smoking clientele and they will lose – lose a lot of business from family that don't want to bring their children into a restaurant...
I think that smoking is a bad and should be banned in a restaurant area because it is an enclosed space where no one has a choice whether or not they're going to breath in the smoke or not.  It gets in the food.  It permeates the – the things you're eating and the air, um, it can affect children whose lungs are not strong, people who have asthma.  In general, there is no benefit to smoking and especially in a restaurant, it is not a good idea.  I think it should be banned because I don't think someone should have the option of being able to affect somebody else's health in that way, especially when it can cause things such as, um, lung cancer or other breathing issues that someone can have, especially when it can affect a mother who has...
I am curious as to whether smoking is banned in restaurants in Japan or not because I think it gives you a different situation.  I know the rooms that exist where people can go to smoke and I think it's cloudy area but that is only for them.  But does that really truly separate you from the – from the population or the people who don't smoke?  If you know you have a habit that's bad, should you therefore inflict on other people or not?  I grew up with my grandfather smoking so I am very used to be in the environment where there is cigarettes smoke and tobacco being consumed, doesn't mean necessarily I like it, I certainly don't think I should put condone or I want to continue that tradition just because I grew up with that.  I think it's more important to be able to respect for the people's spaces especially when you are in a public environment because you're not on your own at that point, so you should take into consideration in a larger area and realize that you are responsible for your own actions as well as being aware...
I disagree with the notion that all smoking should be completely banned in public restaurants.  However, I do believe that there should be ban from being mixed with the general public.  I believe that if an establishment chooses to have a smoking establishment, if that establishment should be entirely separated from the non-smoking establishment, not simply a partition wall but two separate entrances and two separate location.  If people are still there to buy cigarette and smoke in other public places, for example on the street, then I believe that they should be able to contribute to society by going to restaurants and have at public venue.  But I don't believe that the general public who chooses not to smoke, should be exposed to this smell.  I believe that if people want to smoke in public, owners of the establishment should create an environment specifically for the...
I think that smoking should be banned.  It has many harmful consequences to those who choose to smoke and I think that it is unhealthy to those around them.  Individuals that choose to smoke can also get many types of cancer and other unhealthy consequences.  I think that it also end  --  endangers those who are around them and even children who are more likely to pick up such kinds of diseases that are caused by smoking.  I think that smoking should be banned for these reasons and that it would be wise to picking them from restaurants especially because of the eating habits and what takes place in restaurants and it makes the environment and that the family wants or for even people who wish to be able to that type of activity -- 
As I was saying, um, for my mom, her being a smoker and a long-time smoker and all the time she ever went to a restaurant, we actually never sat in the smokers' part of the restaurant, nor have we ever asked them smokers' part of restaurant because we see that as – us – well, as my mom choose smoke, she wouldn't want to affect other people who do not want that at all in their lives.  And this – yet again it is the simple fact that if you do want to take smoke, I understand that nicotine is addictive and, uh, a lot of people cancers they have.  A lot of people have their – have cigarette like one – every 10 to 15 to once every hour so I wouldn't want the person to stop smoking if it's going to cause some pain, but yet again I wouldn't want a smoker to cause – effects on a non-smoker should they – if they want to smoke in restaurants.  Now, you know, it's in outside and I can see that's one [***] but at the restaurant it's solely based on the inside restaurant and, you know, that someone is smoking in that restaurant and it is causing someone...
I believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants and bars for three points.  One, because of the health issues of a person to smoke and also it – it passes down to the – the second-hand smoking and third-hand smoking which leads a person to cancer, diabetes, um, just all the health issues that will arise because of one person smoking which will also consume the people around them.  Second, I think that it's also a peo – people get distracted when they are smoking and eating and drinking so like somebody holding up cell phone and talk – and trying to communicate when we're having dinner.  Restaurants and bars are for interacting with the person so they should not be smoking while they are talking or interacting with the person and last but not least, I believe that a bar is a place to drink...
Yeah, smoking should be banned definitely from restaurants because they affa – it affects, uh, their own personal health of the smoker.  It affects the environment.  It – and it affects other people around them.  Uh, the – the smoker themselves, um, it – it really affects their – their lung and their heart and testosterone and it can cau – it can cause throat cancer, it can ruin your lungs, it can ruin the way you – the way you live your lifestyle and ultimately just, uh, breath, uh, no good – no good effects on you, uh, no good long-term effects.  And secondly the environment – people around you that are trying to eat, trying to – some of them trying to smell and enjoy the aromas of the restaurant and the smoker provides just a – an awful odor and a unprofessional odor and that's something is – that is conducive to the restaurant environment.  Uh, number three, uh, it affects the people around you.  It affects their – it affects people that are breathing in the smoke which has, um, which are...
I believe that smoking could very effectively be banned from private places such as restaurants.  In a place like a restaurant, people are confined in small spaces and people who do not smoke should not be forced to smo  --  have second-hand smoke from people who are smoking.  There are plenty places outside where people could smoke if they choose, but inside a restaurant, it could be detrimental to the health of other people who are not involved in smoking.  Also, restaurants are private places where the owners have the right to decide whether they would or would not ban smoking and if they did decide to do so, it would be very much in their right.  And it would be very much beneficial to  --  toward the health of their constituents and especially for the family oriented restaurant because many families would not like coming to restaurant knowing that there will be people smoking inside where there children could be breathing this.
With smoking actually depend on the brand, the smell is very intense, it gets in your cloth, it can get on your tongue, just the smell of the [***], and also it can make your eyes roll when you're inside of the restaurant prepare to eat meal.  Last thing you want is such a bad smell that there have been – the smell of your food obviously, if cloths can absorb smell and chef foods can absorb it, you know.  It can [***], impair your vision and it's generally not so nice experience when you eat a meal.  Uh, my previous points from the last question still come across obviously, it's bad for your health, and you know it's – it's an equipment to [***] someone's health [***] as well obviously who is smoking – smoking there cigarette and I have been in the restaurants five people smoking then you used to do is slow poison overall.  Now...
The majority of people at restaurants don't smoke, and for that one person I think that person should have enough self-control to refrain from smoking for the duration of his meal, in consideration for others around him and others that are there to enjoy a meal, and he smokes for his own.  Not only for that reason but also for health reasons.  There are many people who does smell smoke and inhaling smoke causes them to feel bad, some people have medical conditions where it could cause them to not breathe well, I think those people with respiratory problems with asthma and specifically and just other things.  A – a person who smokes should know that those around him don't want to smell that and don't want to be in the area and...
Well, we shouldn't make the decision that will be harmful to other people because they are not sure they will be able to make their own decisions.  So yes if for the question smoking should be banned and that, my answer is that it shouldn't be because it's – it's just ignorance.  They just buying and everyone is thinking that maybe it should be also illegalized, so I think it will be good – the other way around you cannot prohibit the – the cigarettes.  If I go the other way like illegalize the weed and tobacco, it would be still available, so I think there is no point in – from banning tobacco and it's really big business so probably it will never happen, so I am sorry guys, but this is – this is more – all right.
I believe that we should not outlaw smoking because if we do, it will only strive to increase the demand and make smoking look cooler and more rebellious to younger and fashionable children and [***].  Back in the 1900s, alcohol was forbidden in the United States, but this had a counterintuitive effect because it strove up the demand very, very high and in effect there were a lot of [***] in America.  If we  --  since we made knowledge on the health effects of smoking more widely known then children will be less likely to engage in smoking knowing that it is very bad for your health.  If we [***] the freewill choice of it then they will likely to engage -- 
I believe the issue of smoking is divisive one, um, smoking in pubs and restaurants and I believe that because it's not a clear-cut answer.  You can't say the government should – are to the charge that the government should ban smoking in all public restaurants.  I would say no.  The reason being, I don't believe the government is responsible for – responsible for what personal owners do in the restaurants.  So I would say that if the – if the public restaurant owner wants to ban smoking in their restaurant, that is a decision for them to make, not for an activist, not for a lobbyist and not for the government to make for them.  On the other hand, if – uh, if you were to say, uh, the consumers have that option too to make a decision on whether they want to go to that restaurant.  Um, they make a choice saying I do want to go to that restaurant, I don't want to go to that restaurant and...
I agree that smoking should be banned in public places around the country because of the dangers of second-hand smoke, also the dangers of littering and throwing cigarettes on the ground and in sewers and water systems that are – that are being poisoned by the elements of the carcinogens in the cigarettes.  It is not necessary for families and young children to breathe the air around someone who decides to live that lifestyle.  It is not healthy and it only increases medical bills and – and – and poor lifestyles of living, people get sick more easy and people who do not want to be smelling bad or affected out in public.  It just – it's a health concern, it is not necessary in this part of, you know, and – and this day and age to be doing that and smoking in public, you can do that in your house and in your own privacy but do not affect the lives of others and – or – or buildings or yellowing the walls and – and – and destroying property...
I think smoking should definitely be illegal in restaurants, and those are kind of everywhere because it doesn't really help anyone, and when you're smoking it's just damaging your body which is increasing your chance for like lung cancer and other things like that.  But also you're affecting a lot of people around you, especially in the restaurants because there are lots of people in the restaurants smelling the air and I think even if it's smoking area, it's not – it doesn't stay still in one area and wind carries it to other places and people smoke with their children around them all the time which is bad for their children.  It's not like their children are choosing smoke, so I don't think it's really good idea for them to be smoking around them.  And I think, yeah, smoking should be illegal just completely because it would be so much bad for everyone's health.  It's – it's just a bad habit that you develop.  No one stops their smoking so I don't think it's a good idea to kind of induce the thing of smoking as it is, I mean, that's why the bans like cigarette adverts and things like that.  I think they should just ban cigarettes altogether and most people would be better off for it, less lung cancer and less health problems, longer life, things much better, yeah definitely a much better option.
Smoking is bad for the environ – the environment because – and should be illegal because it's bad for people, it's bad for the environment and it's also harmful to other people.  First, it's harmful to other people, um, because smoking doesn't just affect you, you have to think about others when you're smoking.  Smoking is bad for you.  It can cause lung cancer in the people that are smoking.  It can also cause cancer in the people that are receiving second-hand smoke and it says that second-hand smoke is more dangerous than first-hand smoke.  It is also bad for the environment.  Plants, trees and other living organisms like animals aren't – don't handle smoke well and it can cause them to die as well.  Not only can it affect the plants, trees and other animals but throwing cigarette butts on the ground can destroy the environment and that's not a good thing.  So, not only it's...
Oh, at the restaurant.  Okay.  Smoking should be banned in restaurants around the country mostly because it is a disgusting habit.  The smoke smells bad.  It can affect the flavor of your food.  It can harm other people who are in the area.  There is an effect on that second-hand smoking and that is when other people who are not smoking can inhale the fumes that are let off by – by the cigarettes and second-hand smoke can cause lung cancer.  It can cause oral cancer.  It can cause generally nausea, especially in the restaurant setting when you can smell the smoke and you're trying to eat your food, it's not – not pleasant at all, even it – with – when you have smoking sections and non-smoking sections but smoke for me it's throughout the entire building.  And if I were to walk into a restaurant and smell cigarette smoke, I am not...
Um, thank you very much.  Like I was saying before that, um, smoking should be totally – from my own opinion to – smoking should be totally prohibited – should be totally stopped in countries, in every country because it's really not good for one's health.  It affects the lungs.  It affects the chest and the life of the – a smoker is really shorter than a normal person.  So, I think smoking should be banned in every country, in every restaurant, but totally banned and then government should really, really like smokers on the – stop the smoking thing because it's really not good.  So that is my opinion.  And then for younger generation who are coming up and they are really emulating from other people who smoke which means that smoking will never be stopped if government do not put eyes into – in other to stop.
At a restaurant it should definitively be no-smoking whatsoever because it's bad for everyone and then it being trapped in confined space and United States already illegal to smoke in a restaurant.  So, I think it should be banned everywhere but definitely yes in a restaurant because you're trying to eat and you can make everything taste weird and smell bad and give the bad atmosphere.  And people that are addicted to it should be at least be able to go a little bit without smoking.  So, in a restaurant 100% ban and I think it should be a 100% ban to everywhere because it's definitely bad for your health.  you're a lot higher to get a lung cancer, lot higher to get too much every kind of cancer and every bad health and this is not good for you.  So no smoking in a restaurant or in your house would be...
Smoking in a restaurant is wrong because people are there to enjoy a nice clean atmosphere, enjoy – and to enjoy good food whether it's with friend or family because smoking can be a bit of a hindrance as well whether it's inside or outside of a restaurant or some other bui – building.  It's a distraction also.  It – um, it also could like ru – could like ruin the food or ruin people's appetite because they can't concentrate on having fun with their family or friend at the restaurant and enjoy their food because the smoke – smoking is so bad, especially for those with asthma and children, they could get sick from the smoke inhalation, especially for infants which are – for them it's a mysterious part because infant again...
I believe that a smoking area and a non-smoking area is a personal matter for a smoker or a non-smoker.  Personally, I do not smoke and I do not understand why a person feels the need of smoking, but I understand that it – that is a personal preference.  I – I do believe however that there needs to be a distinct difference, um, between the place.  If I go to a restaurant and do not want to sit in a place and smell the smoke coming from a non-smoky – uh – coming from a smoking area just because, uh, there is a smoking area, they should – they either have a glass or a completely cutoff area so that I can enjoy my, um, dining experience without being bothered by the smoke from it.  Like I said, I believe it's a personal preference and whether that person wants to smoke out in public or not that is...
Yes, I do believe that smoking is not good to do in restaurants especially because, um, first of all, it's very harmful for your body and then it is bad for digestion.  Um, when you're smoking at a restaurant too, it can definitely, um, deter another person's experience so this is not preferred to smoke, even though there are non-smoking area, the smoke can – can come over into the non-smoking areas.  And, um, that is not ethical to do if someone else does not think smoking is okay, um, smoking is very bad for your health so to smoke, um, is treating your body poorly and therefore is not, um, good stewardship and is not a good, um, use of money and finances can be, um, uh, come into a big play there so in order to, um, in order to be able to...
Yes, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants because it's a health hazard.  People who go out to eat and enjoy the meal with their family and friends and don't have to worry about health concerns, they have such as asthma, other respiratory problems.  If they have respiratory problems, then those who do not smoke, it hurts, their respiratory problems are triggered by smoke will be, um, caused to have problems if they are around people who are smoking even if they themselves are not smoking.  If smoking is banned in all restaurants people will not have to worry about developing problems with respiratory symptoms due to other smoking around them.  Also, it's a health hazard for those who are smoking, um, and it should be banned in general for them because it is unhealthy and dangerous to their like own health and – or – if they are smoking.  Yes, I do believe that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants so that others health being good of all parties involved both the smokers...
I believe that it would be very wise thing for our leaders in our country to ban smoking because it is hazardous to health and it – it – it's no good whatsoever, all does it cause health issues and – and also I believe it is wrong in a Christian standpoint, um, even Christians do smoke today unfortunately.  But, um, going – going back to Corinthians 6:16 – uh, 6:19 says that um, “What? Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?”  It's saying that, um, what we do matters for Christ anything that we do for that matches the world in any way makes us not look like Christ but rather the world and this is wrong because as Christians we are not supposed to match world, we are supposed to be more and more like Christ every day and not be like the world at all.  Now, it also talks about, um, saving our body, you know, our...
Do I think smoking should be banned in all the restaurants throughout the country?  I think it should.  I think if there is an outside area, I think it will be okay because that area has a lot more open air and the fumes can't, uh, cause as much of problem with other people as it would if you were in a room, uh, rooms have less ventilation than, you know, the open air outside and so I think if there was a smoking area, then it would be okay.  But for the most part, uh, smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country and I thought it was – well, at least my understanding was that it is not allowed in public places in the United States, but I can't be for sure, I have to look that up.  So, I think for my conclusion, I would say that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the United...
Yes, I believe smoking should be completely banned from restaurants for two primary reasons.  One, it's unhealthy for the person who is smoking.  It can have a lot of health risks and it can also teach that smoking is something that is not serious and does not, um, add health risks.  And two is it's harmful for the people around the smoker.  It would, uh, cause them to not want to go out public as much.  A lot of people are sensitive to smoke and a lot of people who are uncomfortable around, uh, someone who is smoking and it can ruin their experience at a restaurant and ruin their taste for, um, the food and it can just make the family experience not as enjoyable and so smoking should be banned for that.  People who go to restaurants, I think, it's a full experience that they want and that, um, those who are smoking can choose not to smoke there because, um, they can smoke anywhere in private, but in a restaurant it's – because other people want to the smoke and it can make them uncomfortable for them as well.
I feel like smoking should be banned in the restaurants because it has many bad quality that it gives a person is in the restaurant for one makes the restaurant smell bad and it makes, um, everything bad if the smokers seeping into smell bad.  Um, it's also very unhealthy – very unhealthy for not only the person smoking but also the people around them that are smoking.  Um, smoking can also, um, cause damage besides just – you know, smoke damage that touches the wall and things like that.  It can also catch something on fire.  It's the cigarettes itself on the floor.  If somebody around them is bringing in the oxygen tank then that could, um, you know, potentially combust.  Smoking is not good in any establishment but especially in a restaurant where you are serving food and, um, people could be eating food that's you know...
All right.  Now, I understand the question.  I didn't hear – understand the first time.  Yes, I do believe that ban – smoking should be banned from restaurants because so many – because it's something that so disagreeable among people in the response and the right should pretty much be taken away from everyone to begin with.  If someone can agree on specific thing then there should – then we shouldn't have to actually have to argue about it, such as takeaway the smoking from the restaurants because so many people are compact in the same area that it's just not right to have to have many other people suffer for the sake of one person.  Um, that person, it's not hard for him to just go outside and smoke to pieces on addiction to a cigarette rather than affecting so many people around them would have who may actually have health problems.  So that is my stance on the particular topic and that I do not think that it is right to have...
Cigarettes are harmful.  They are objects of distraction and therefore should not be allowed inside public institution.  When people take these cigarette into institutions, they are not only harming themselves, they are also harming the people around them by presenting this pollutant into the air that could cause serious attacks for some people, but if people who go out to restaurants have asthma, they could have breathing problems, they could have a cold or bronchitis or any number of things.  These things make it really hard to breathe just normally, but when someone introduces smoke into that equation, you are actually making it harder for them.  Not only this but second-hand smoke can also be just as harmful to a person as first-hand smoke.  So, when you're in these environments, you could be potentially presenting the possibility of lung cancer into the people around you because you are damaging the air that they are breathing...
...matter of personal choice and personal, you know, uh, desire.  And we can't really stop people from doing anything they choose.  You can put laws and rules out there, but the people have to choose whether or not they follow and that's the beautiful thing about, you know what God does to us.  He has given us rules to, you know, follow and we will have to follow them, but it's a matter of choice [***] so, um, I am really not so sure about banding smoke.  I don't know about that.  Will the world be a better place without smoking, I think yes for sure but you go to restaurants, you know, and they control because you have areas where it's non-smoking and areas for smoking.  People who don't like smoking go to areas that people don't smoke, and those who want to smoke go to areas where they can smoke, but it's a tough question because if you – people – we are – we are given a free will, a free choice and...
