I don't agree that smoking should be banned at all – at all restaurants in Japan, but I don't smoke and I like going to restaurants that – that don't allow smoking or have a separate section that I don't have to sit too close to, but I – I feel that if a restaurant owner doesn't mind people smoking in a restaurant then that's fine.  Uhm, I mean, I wished nobody smoked personally but – but it is their choice as long as they are adults, and uhm, I would be more likely to go res – to go to a restaurant where nobody is smoking, but you know, that's just my personal opinion.  Uhm, I mean, I still, I – I guess I just think people should have the choice and if you want to let people smoke in your restaurant, that's fine, I just don't want to sit next to them, and, uh, I think – I think cigarettes should be heavily taxed...
Yes, I believe and firmly believe that can't – that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  In fact, I would go further and say, it should be banned in all public places.  It's been proven – scientifically proven that sm – smoke, tobacco smoke is a cancer causing – uh, a cancer causing, environmental – it has a cancer causing environmental impact.  Separate areas for smokers and nonsmokers in – in restaurants is ineffective.  Second-hand smoke is just as bad as direct smoking.  I smoked for a number of years myself and believe that the having quit smoking has improved my life and – and generally improved my outlook and health.  One must try to do what is right, not just for oneself, but for other people and smoke...
I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country.  This is mainly for health reasons as smoking is extremely dangerous for the people who are actually smoking and in terms of second-hand smoke for other people in the immediate vicinity as well.  If smoking were banned in restaurants, more families and people who are – have adverse reactions to smoke would find that they would like to go out to restaurants more.  It would be a boon for the economy and for many restaurants and also help people's health problems as well.  In order to accommodate people who still like to smoke, you could have outdoor smoking areas where they can leave the restaurant or go into a private smoking room and smoke their cigarettes there.  This would keep the air clean for everybody in the restaurant and make for a much more pleasurable eating experience.  These are the reasons why I think smoking would most...
Yes, I think it's – uh, smoking should be banned in restaurants.  For someone who doesn't smoke like myself when you go into a nice restaurant with your friends and you know a person sits down next to you and sparks up a cigarette, you don't want to be, you want to taste your steak and not their second-hand smoke.  In – in Australia, you're not allowed to smoke in indoors – indoors anywhere and you have to be more than 4 meters away from any door or entrance to any – to anything.  Whereas in Japan you know you go out to a club or a restaurant, you come home smelling like smoke and your eyes burn and you just can't breathe just for people who don't smoke and it's yeah.  Designated smoking spots at convenient stores, I think that's not overly great idea.  Smoking should be allowed anywhere in public I think, but indoors it should be yeah, yeah, limited to you know may be gentlemen's bars or you know specific places, but in restaurants definitely no smoking.
No, I don't think that smoking should be completely ban – banned from restaurants.  However, there may be you know argument that it could be partially banned or specific areas – smoking areas or even not smoking in the eating area, but smoking area set aside, possibly outside.  Uh, some people may think that it's discriminatory against smokers to ban smoking completely in restaurants.  There is the argument that it could be completely banned.  It...
I think with a sufficiently ventilated and separated area, smoking areas can be kept in restaurants.  Unless smoking is entirely eliminated from society, there isn't a practical way really to – there isn't really a practical reason to keep smokers segregated so fully from a population.  Their condition is legally an addiction, so providing an, uhm, area where it can be indulged that doesn't disturb the other patrons as long as it's fully ventilated and doesn't disturbance the other patrons, then I don't think it should be removed.  It's a personal choice for no smoke...
Should smoking be banned at all restaurants in the country?  By this country I think you – you're referring to Japan.  Hell, yeah, I mean common, look at Nagoya, you can't smoke in Sakai or Fushimi or Kanayama Station.  We're not even taking inside, we're talking outside.  They say it's safety to protect the kids from being hit by cigarettes and yadi, yadi, yadi, yadi, yada, but the thing is smoking is banned in indoors in – in America and everywhere standard bar and the fact is smoking is bad, second-hand smoke is harmful, and just because you have to smoke or because you're addicted to nicotine this doesn't mean you have the right to share that addiction with the people around you.  A study show that second-hand smoke is harmful and I don't even like the smell of restaurants that al – allow smoking and fuck, I'm a smoker, dude.  I smoke two packs a day and even when I'm in a bar like in Nagoya, if there is a child or someone around me, I go outside...
I agree, however I think there is an important point to make.  First of all, I agree because u – unlike other activities smoking can have a negative impact on me even though I'm not doing it.  For example, if the person at the table next to me is smoking, then that person's smoke or second-hand smoke as it's called will affect me.  For this reason alone, I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants, and I am happy when I – I go back to Canada to see that restaurants have banned it.  However, I also think that it's important for people to have choices and to be able to make choices by themselves.  Having said that, I think restaurants should have a separate smoking section that is enclosed within the restaurants for those people who wish to smoke.  That would...
I completely agree, uhm, as banning cigarette smoking in public places has been something that's become popular in my country, and I think when I first came to Japan, I was quite shocked to go into a lounge area and watch a mother smoke a cigarette with a child in her knee which is just something I would never see in my country.  Maybe like 30 to 50 years ago, but not now and you know I've also been through several nice little cafes that have been ruined by the smoking – people smoking and it's unfortunate that they can't make the restaurant or café non-smoking because it would affect their business.  Now, I always believe that it would help people, uh, reduce smoking in public restaurants if the government would assist in passing a – a law or where – where it, uh, would be banned.
Uhm, no, I – I don't agree with the statement.  I think some restaurants – it should be okay for you to smoke in some restaurants.  I think they should have a designated smoking area and put that separate from the rest of their restaurant and then it's no problem I think.  Uhm, if you do that if you allow restaurants smoke – to allow smokers then restaurants are free to choose if they have smokers or not and then people can decide if they want to go to a smoke-free restaurant, if they want to go to a restaurant in which smoking is allowed or a restaurant in which you know there is a smoking area or a non-smoking area or what have you.  I don't think it's necessary for the government or authorities to regulate that.  I think the market will decide ultimately what – what should happen, people should be free to make their own choice.  Uhm, it can't be a little bit annoying when someone bl – blows a load of smoke in your face when you're try...
I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country.  My experience in countries where bans like that have been put in place has been that people usually come to accept it and even smokers would usually agree that, uh, restaurants without any smoking at all are more pleasant to be – to be in.  It's also a health risk for the – for the employees who spend a lot more time in that environment than – than the – even the customers.  So, uh, unless they – unless they are prepared to – to quit their jobs I don't think they should – should be subjected to the dangers that passive smoking, uhm, entail.  Uh, even though some restaurants might suffer a drop in – in – in custom clientele in the short run, my experience the – the numbers usually pickup again in bars and restaurants as well after a short time.
I disagree.  I do not believe that, uh, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  I – I think, uh, it's important for people who don't smoke to have a clear and safe environment to go out to eat or to socialize and, uh, do those sorts of things.  But, I also think it's important for smokers to have that same sort of environment and if you ban smoking in – in all restaurants or bars or whatnots, uhm, it removes any sort of opportunity for people to – uh, to smoke and, uh, smokers into smoking regardless of the – the damage to person's health.  Uh, people smoke and they – they chose to do it that's...
I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants because not only do people when they smoke, they are har – they are harming themselves, but they are also harming the people around them.  I think it is unfair for smokers to smoke anywhere in public.  I think that smokers should smoke only in the privacy in their own home or in an isolated area where the contamination of the smoke can only be affected by themselves or other smokers.  I think non-smokers breathing in the second hand smoke at a restaurant should be illegal and it should not be allowed.  Smoking is a dangerous and addictive habit which addiction to smoking is a drug.  It's – it's harmful to your health.  It kills you and it's also addicting – highly addicting that people smoke for many, many years.  So, regardless of the comfortability with the – with the – with the smokers, I think it's very bad...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants all over the country.  Um, yeah, the reason being that, uh, uh, people shouldn't have to – people shouldn't have to put up with smoke in their face while they're eating.  Uh, non-smokers shouldn't have to have their air polluted by, you know, smoke or cigarette smoke.  Uh, it's unhealthy to be breathing it in especially if you're a non-smoker.  Uh, second-hand smoke is unhealthy that is um, and it's just unpleasant.  It's an unpleasant breathing experience if you have to be breathing in smoke while you're eating.  Not only that, uh, well, I think tobacco [***] and that essentially will be healthier as a whole.  They are even proven to be [***] in the US after they put smoking bans on most eating establishment.
Okay, uh, the question was, uhm, do I think that smoking should be banned at the mall or restaurants in the country assuming the country is Japan?  Uh, yeah, as a nonsmoker, I think it would be great.  Uhm, it's better for everybody's health.  Your clo – your clothes don't smell.  Uhm, it's better for everybody's health, uhm, yeah.  I mean, yeah.  Maybe food taste better.  I mean it is more pleasant I guess but, uhm, as for it – as for nonsmokers, I'm not sure that they appreciate that but, well, I don't know.  You got to talk about who's – who takes precedence here, whether it's the nonsmokers or the smokers.  I mean, like I said, uhm, I'm – I'm a nonsmoker so I don't really love smoking or smell – breathing in other people's smoke, uh, probably it would be bad for me but, uhm - I mean...
I'm of the opinion that smoking should be banned in the restaurants.  It's mainly for the health concern really.  Uhm, it's not really a – a good thing to be trapped inside a room with a - a lot of smoke.  Uhm, many carcinogenic substances in the air in that and, furthermore, it's quite irritating when you're eating a meal.  Uhm, you want to be able to taste and smell all the things that you want to eat opposed to the smell of tobacco and smoke and nicotine and whatever really.  So I think it's - it's definitely a good idea.  Certainly, I noticed in Japan that, uhm, you can smoke in a lot of places inside still which is quite strange for a developed country.  I know a lot of Western countries and European countries and such don't allow that anymore.  There's no smoking in rooms like that, it's just all nonsmoking.  So, uh, I think that that's probably a good idea to ban...
Yes, I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because smoking is unhealthy.  It's bad for our health.  It stains our teeth.  It creates a very, very, very bad overall body condition.  It's terrible for our taste buds, so we lose some of the sensation of the food from smoking.  Second-hand smoke is cancer causing.  So, for people who don't smoke, when you have smoking in a restaurant, it is a terrible thing to have to force people to smell that terrible smelling smoke.  Um, smoking also, ah, alters the flavor and the taste of the food.  So, while I may not be a smoker, the person next to me is, my food is changed due to their smoking in the restaurants.  Smoke, uh, smoking makes the restaurant filthy.  There's a lot of smoke and odorous smell that linger long after the smoking has ceased in the restaurant.  It's...
I think that smoking should be banned in all public places and not just in restaurants.  Um, we've known about the dangers of passive smoking for a long time now and there is no excuse for allowing people to smoke in public places anymore.  When you smoke, you're not just endangering your own health, you're also endangering the health of those around you.  Um, this might include children or elderly people, particularly children.  The children haven't chosen to be in that place and yet they are being exposed to the dangers of passive smoking which can cause, um, all kinds of serious health problems.  In the past, we used to think that only smokers were harmed by their own actions for smoking, but now of course, we know that as I said, you're not just harming yourself.  You're also harming other people around you.  So, I believe that smoking should be banned in all public places.  Um, the only place where I think you should be allowed to smoke is in a designated smoking area and as far as possible, I think we should reduce these...
I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in this country which I assume is Japan.  Where I come from in Canada, I believe that smoking is already banned in all restaurants.  You cannot smoke at all in restaurants.  I think most people even smokers will agree that smoking is an unhealthy habit, and for that reason, it does not have a place in public restaurants where children or babies could be present.  Even if the restaurants has a closed off designated smoking area, some restaurants in some cases, this area is not properly confined.  Some – restaurants, it is open.  So, the smoke still makes it into non-smoking areas and it's...
I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants because smoke is offensive to a lot of people.  Second-hand smoke is then shown to be more dangerous than, um, primary smoke ah.  At a restaurant, there are children, there are people who have asthma, there are people who have breathing disorders.  So, if you have a smoking section that's just completely sealed off and airtight, then it's going to offend the people who don't smoke.  It's going to cause health problems for the people who don't smoke, and smoking is an invasive, um, ha – habit.  If you smoke, other people will smell your smoke.  Other people will breathe your smoke.  So, in restaurants or in public at all, I think smoking should be banned.  I think it's a very dirty...
Uh, yeah, that's a hard question, another hard question.  Um, I disagree with that because smoking, it's – people who smoke, smoking is actually one of their hobbies I guess.  Like people who like give us music, people who like to play sports, that's a hobby but people who smoke, by smoking, it lessens their stress and – but people who smoke should take care of others around them like use an ashtray or not throw away the cigarettes on the streets.  So, by people who smoke, they should tend to watch out for others when they smoke.  So, I disagree with this question because I have...
You know, I don't think so because ah, restaurants are private establishments run by private individuals, ah, in the case of restaurants owners and I think that sort of choice should be left up to the restaurant.  Ah, I think it's up to the restaurant owner to make sure that all the patrons understand that this is a smoking establishment or a certain portion of the establishment is smoking, but I don't think it's very fair for a – a government or some outside authority to coerce a restaurant into ah, into having certain types of ah, customers or not.  Um, take for example bars.  Um, why only restaurants?  Why restrict only restaurants?  Why not extend that sort of statute to a bar?   And you could see what kind of um, economical problem that would cause for a bar where many, if not all, of their pat...
I have a strong feeling about this topic because I'm a smoker myself.  Um, I think it's quite reasonable to ban smoking at the vast majority of restaurants.  After all, nowadays, most people don't smoke and I think we need to take account of their taste.  It's also important for people who work in restaurants and who would be otherwise exposed to smoke –second hand smoke every day.  I'm not sure actually – I'm not convinced myself by the data against second-hand smoking but even so I think these workers have a benefit of the doubt – have a benefit of the doubt.  Such as they're maybe – parts of workers seemed to be people are quite poor and have no choice but to work there.  On the other hand, I don't think it's fair to ban it completely.  I think there should be one in 10 or one in 20 restaurants that are licensed to allow smoking.  Uh, that could be looked after by the policemen say the number of licensed pubs is developed [***] by the police.  I think that way, you'd – you'd um, you'd would give the smokers a chance to smoke but you also wouldn't force workers to work in that particular restaurant.  There would be plenty of choice for them to work in other places.
I disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants.  I think that as long as there are certain smoking areas that are closed off, so non-smokers can have a separate area and smokers can have a separate area and the areas are completely separated, then I don't understand if there's a problem with this.  I think that children should not be allowed into the smoking areas in the restaurants.  Children should be banned from the smoking areas, but as adults, we are able to make our own decisions of what we would like to do is, so it's our choice which area we choose to sit in and as long as the smoking room is not affecting the non-smoking room, then...
Smoking should definitely be banned in all restaurants.  Customers, like me, for example, don't like the smell.  Uh, we go to restaurants to smell the food, uh, not the smoke.  Also, it's dangerous.  I mean, it's bad for people's health.  So, they shouldn't be exposed to carcinogens such as tobacco byproducts and customers won't come to the shop.  So, it should be banned, because this reduces consumerism in fact and it leads to economy downfall.  Also, parents don't want their kid exposed to smoke.  I, for one, don't like it and I don't enjoy, uh, tolerating smokers with my kids present especially.  Only 15% of Australia...
I think that, uhm, smoking should be banned in all restaurants, because I think it's kind, I'm a non-smoker and I think it's kind of disgusting to smell.  You know, you are hungry, want to eat and then, the smo – smoke, like even some people smoke like cigars or something like that.  It's like, I don't know, I – I – I feel like, think of the smell and like, and my hunger goes away and, um, yeah, it's like, it's not, and it's not good for their own – for the non-smoking people like they have and you know, and after you go home, your – your clothes will stink like from – from smoke and all, you know.  It's really disgusting, I mean.  I should, it should be banned, because in the – in the end, it's like a restaurant.  It's like food in the, people are eating and you know, all those smoke and the stuff like.  It's – it's – it ruins the feelings of romantic dinner and something, you know, and you know, people should go outside and smoke, not inside, you know.  It's like, they can smoke on the street or outside that nobody is...
I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in Japan.  In my country, in Australia, smoking has already been banned in all public places, in restaurants, in live music avenues, in clubs, in bars for the past nearly 10 years and I think that most people would agree that has been very, very beneficial to the Australian public.  Not only does the air encourage – the air inside restaurants, bars, clubs and live houses encourage people to stay and socialize longer, I mean that people become ostracized if they smoke by – smoke in public places such as that.  It's obviously very, very – it's not very polite to smoke in public places in front of other people, if other people obviously are different.  The health issues, especially with their lungs and things like that, some people are – they have children and things like that.  So, I think it's very, very important I mean.  I'm actually rather surprised that Japan has not introduced this any earlier.  In fact, that I do think that people do need their licenses [***] and their practice in order...
No, I wouldn't agree with that, um, topic of banning smoking in all restaurants.  That would actually be a little bit totat - totalitarian.  Each city or each area can probably have their own rules and their own legislations for each states or prefectures and it would up be up to the local people to decide what to actually do with this kind of rule.  Uh, of course, a lot of the smokers up there would get pretty upset not being able to smoke in a restaurant.  Uh, the non-smokers would be happy however, although, we haven't really seen this in the world today.  We have seen some cities ban public smoking outside and some cities...
Yeah, I agree with the statement that all smoking should be banned in restaurants.  When I want to – the reason I want is that when I go to eat my dinner, I want to enjoy the food that I'm tasting not having to have a taste of the cigarette smoke in my face all the time.  It gets in – in the way of the enjoyment and my time out with my friends enjoying that wonderful time having a good meal together.  Also, when I come home, I don't have to smell like I've been in a tobacco shop and my everything smells of tobacco, my hair smells of tobacco, my clothes smell of tobacco and also, there's many cases of studies showing that secondhand smoke is a major cause of cancer and that comes from people being in environment...
I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  Personally, I find it disgusting to eat while somebody is smoking near me.  I also feel, you don't get the same taste and smells from the food that it may [***] your senses when there is smoke in the room.  Coming from England where smoking is banned inside buildings, it's difficult for me in Japan to go to a restaurant where there is smoking.  I hate when you wake up in the morning and your clothes smell of smoke and your hair smells of smoke.  Everything smells very bad.  Also, the smoking environment gives me a sore throat.  So, the next morning sometimes, I find that I can't speak properly or I have a sore throat.  Also, I think that people choose to smoke, but so why shouldn't people that don't smoke get the choice to smoke as well.
Okay.  Um, I disagree with this statement.  Although, I am a non-smoking person, um, I think, for you to ban out people from smoking at a private area is not – um, is not something – I mean, I think it's good for the majority of the people, but, uh, it kind of excludes people that are smokers.  But I do think that they should get closed off in a sense, uh, in an area if they actually want to smoke or oh yes, or have a room where they can go smoking.  Uh, I know that here in Japan they have that not so much where I come from in the States, but, uh, I think it's a good idea that they have that here in Japan were they have smoking rooms, so you don't have to completely, uh, ban out...
Yes, I agree with the topic that smoking should be banned completely in restaurants.  Smoking is very harmful.  Both smoking yourself and passive smoking, uh, kills people, and by smoking in a restaurant, um, you are effectively killing other customers.  Even if a restaurant has a smoking and nonsmoking section, you are still damaging people, because the smoke travels through the air and it – people will breath it in.  It's impossible to separate completely the smoking air and the nonsmoking air from other p – customers.  Children will also be in the restaurants, and it's very dangerous for children, in particular, to breathe in smoke.  So, to be a good customer and help those in the restaurant, it's good not to smoke.
I personally do not like smoking at all.  I've never done it, I don't like the smell, I don't like to be around it.  However, when we say that we should conclusively ban it from all restaurants, it's very broad statement, and on that note, I would have to say, no, we should not do that.  Just as I should be entitled to my right to be in a restaurant and not have smoke in my face, similarly there should be opportunity, there should be types of restaurants or parts of restaurants that are cordoned off and sectioned off where people can smoke if that's what they want to do.  Uh, culture comes into this again, you know, for United States, eating in is really – you know we are generally on public setting, everyone's out in an open dining room area, so there is not as much...
I do not believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.  I think that any extreme measure where you include every single instance for  in this case of restaurants or will include bars in that is a – is an extreme curbing of freedom and it severely limits personal freedom as well as personal options.  While smoking is certainly an unhealthy habit, any smoker will tell you that it is also a highly social habit and places where people gather, such as restaurants and bars are in some ways ideal places for this activity to occur.  This is all dependent, of course, on employees preference.  They would be able to choose to work in a smoking or a nonsmoking facility, but it should be up to the owner whether to establish that rule or not.  It should not be decided by...
I believe that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants.  This is because mainly of the choice available to people in the matter.  Smokers have two choices, to smoke or not to smoke inside a restaurant.  Nonsmokers do not have the choice not to be exposed to smoke if there is no complete ban on smoking in restaurants.  If there was a ban – complete, total ban on smoking in restaurants, smokers would still have the choice to go outside and smoke, but nonsmokers would have the right to be able to enjoy a meal without having smoke interfere with their...
Yes.  I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  Smoking here in Japan is especially prevalent more so than in my home country, Australia, and this affects the health of all other people inside the restaurant where people are smoking in a closed environment through second-hand smoke.  It also affects the enjoyment of the meal of the people around them and also for the people who are actually smoking, it also dulls their taste sensation so they can't enjoy their meals and their food as much either which is unfortunate.  Also, for the health of the broader society, it's very important for the governments – local state and federal – to put restrictions on where people can smoke for the health of the broader society of the people who do...
Uhm, yes.  I think that's a good idea.  I think that's fair.  I think that's a civilized thing to do.  In Canada, where I'm from, they illegalized smoking in all public places back in 2003.  Uhm, eh, I mean as a nonsmoker myself, uhm, I much more enjoy going out to clubs and bars and such knowing that I won't be polluted and suffocated by other people's habit, you know, while I'm trying, you know, to enjoy myself.  Uhm, I have very sensitive nostrils.  My nose gets stuffed up and clogs very easily.  I have trouble breathing.  Uhm, when you have a nonsmoking and smoking sections, it doesn't really do anything because of the way the density of smoke works.  If someone smokes on one side of the room, what happens is the density of smoke becomes equal all across the room so that everyone gets the second-hand smoke equally and I think that's really unfair.  I don't want to die of cancer.  I think cancer is a – it's a horrific way to die and, uhm, I shouldn't have to be killed by somebody...
I think smoking should be banned in all the restaurants because smoking is not something that can be confined just to the person who is smoking.  The smoke spreads around, uhm, and can interfere with people around them, people who are nonsmokers.  And this is not only, uhm, unhealthy for them, but the smell of it clings to the clothes and they have to carry that smell with them then for the rest of the day or evening.  And I would often – if I went out to restaurants where people were smoking around me, when I came home, I would just have to put all of my clothes in the wash and then probably want to take a shower to remove that smell.  And also I'd been breathing that smoke as well which isn't healthy and that's something which I didn't ask for.  So to have no smoking in all the restaurants is going to be a huge benefit to all of the people who do not...
There are a lot of countries who have already banned smoking in all public places, uhm, and if Japan were to go in the same direction, I can see that there would be a lot of benefits and also some downsides to – to taking that path.  Uhm, one issue is that, of course, smoking is very bad for the health and people who are working in establishments in which smoking is allowed are at risk of many different diseases and to protect them and to have safety in the workplace, it would be better to ban smoking outright.  Uhm, I'm also dissatisfied with the way that smoking sections are often organized in restaurants and even if you're sitting in a nonsmoking section, smoke, of course, travels across the room and can quite easily start to, uhm, affect nonsmokers and I often come out of coffee shops in particular smelling like I have also been smoking even though I don't.
I agree with this statement how smoking should be banned.  It is because, well, first of all, uhm, I'm not a smoker and I'm completely against, uh, smoking since it's not healthy.  It's not healthy for just the smokers, uh, but also for the people around them like their family as well because they turn out to be a second-hand smoker.  And, nowadays, uh, even in the news, they talk about the PM2.5 where the particles of the smoke, uh, it's really, really small.  It could get into your lung.  It will cause, uh, things like, uh, lung cancer.  So I really think it should be banned, that, not even in restaurants but it could – within the country because it's not healthy and it could – if by banning it, we could probably increase the – the number of, uh, helping people rather than...
Yes, I really strongly agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants and even public buildings.  Uhm, this has already taken effect in New Zealand and it is great in my opinion.  Uhm, I am a nonsmoker myself and, uhm, being here, in Japan, entering restaurants where there's other people smoking, the smell is just horrendous and it's hard for me to even breath before another person smoking.  Uhm, and this just gets onto the health risks and it affects the staff and other patrons where second-hand smoke has been linked to cancer and all sorts of horrible nastiness and I much rather be in a restaurant where people are not smoking and I'm sure that the staff don't want other people's smoke getting into their clothes and inhaling other people's second-hand smoke and...
Okay.  This is a bit of a tricky subject for me.  I, myself, am not a smoker.  However, I have a lot of friends who do smoke and I often dine with them and for myself personally, it really doesn't bother me.  I guess I'm kind of used to it.  However, I did have children and I don't want them to be around the smoke because there's a lot studies that say second-hand smoke is no good. You know, I don't like the idea of having a smoking section because I think that you can't completely block out the smoke.  So I think a restaurant either has to be no smoking or smoking is acceptable.  I think that's okay but the restaurant should clearly state this is a smoking restaurant so that the consumer has a choice whether or not to visit that establishment or not.  But total ban, I don't think it's – it's completely necessary.  But as long as...

The notion is that, you know, smoking should be banned from all restaurants.  In the UK, this is the case.  I am a nonsmoker.  I believe that smokers should respect nonsmokers' rights.  I am happy that smoking is being banned and I wish that Japan would follow suit, but I also believe smokers have rights. I think there should be some places where they can eat a meal and smoke.  I think that's an important part of their liberty, so restaurants should have a smoking room.  And I mean, yes, a smoking section that kind of goes against a complete ban...

I believe that smoking should be banned in all public – public venues including restaurants.  So of you may disagree with this saying that you know it infringes upon people's rights or – or their, you know, ability to choose, you know, what they want to do with their lives.  But really, smoking around other people and the effects that second-hand smoke have on others is the infringement.  You know, Abraham Lincoln, I believe it was said that your right to swing your fist ends where the other person's jaw – other person's jaw begins and, in this case it would be where their lungs begin.  And you know I – I guess there is an argument that could be made about have smoking sections or that kind of thing, but second-hand smoke travels around a room so unless you are going to have the people completely quarantined, making them feel like outcasts in the process, it doesn't really accomplish what it – it's meant to accomplish.  Even...

This happens to be a topic about which I have strong feelings as I am a smoker myself.  I fully understand why people feel that it should be banned in most restaurants.  Nowadays, most people, it seems to me, do not smoke or at least – yes, I think most people do not smoke.  I think it's fair to say that now.  Probably depends partly on what country you are in but I think in general most people do not smoke.  So most restaurants should be free of smoking.  This is important not only for the customers but also for the workers. Some of them are strictly part-time workers, might not have much choice actually about whether or not they can get a job or where they can get a job.  But I don't see there's any reason to ban it completely.  I think some places – a minority of places, say 1 in 10 or 1 in 20, should be licensed rather like private clubs at some way that it is possible to smoke.  You would get a special license and it would only be available in certain – I mean the police would control how many could have it in an area.  I think that would be fair.  There would be somewhere for smokers to go and okay...

Well, I'm from Canada and that's been illegal since 2003 and I always liked that because I'm very sensitive to smoke and a nonsmoking section doesn't really help any because of the way the density of smoke works.  If somebody is smoking in the corner of a room, eventually, the density of the smoke will be equivalent to right across the room, so that a person across on the other side of room can have the second-hand smoke just as badly as a person sitting right beside the smoker getting the second-hand smoke.  And I don't think that I should get cancer because of somebody else's disgusting, stupid, pitiful habit. And so I guess I definitely do think it should be illegalized in Japan just like it has been illegalized now in many places in the world like Canada, America.  And it's really bothersome when I am sitting there trying to eat and I have this smell, the second-hand smoke of somebody in the nonsmoking section when I'm in the smoking section because those walls don't really do much at all, the separation and all that.  Smoke finds a way.  Or if I'm walking to the washroom which is...

I agree completely that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.  There are several reasons for this.  The first being that the smoke from the cigarettes will contaminate the food and clothes of other people in the restaurant – in the restaurant and some people may not like having the smell while they are eating.  The food will taste bad if cigarette smoke is – I don't know how to say it. If people can – can smell cigarette smoke at the same time they are eating, the food – the flavor of the food will change and people may not like it.  Somebody has to clean up the cigarettes and the ashtrays afterwards and people who work in restaurants may not always clean well enough as they may not use the correct...

Okay.  The question was do I think that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants in the country, assuming the country is Japan.  As a nonsmoker, I think it would be great.  It is better for everybody's health.  Your- your clothes don't smell.  it's better for everybody's health.  Uhm, yeah, I mean – yeah, maybe food tastes better.  I mean, it is more pleasant I guess but as for it – as for nonsmokers, I'm not sure that they appreciate that but – well, I don't know.  You got to talk about who is – who takes precedence here, whether it's the nonsmokers or the smokers.  I mean, like I said, I am a nonsmoker so I don't really love smoking or smell – breathing in other people's smoke.  Probably it would be bad for me but I mean...

Smoking is gross.  There's – there's no – there's no way around that.  It smells bad.  It has been proven – you know, cigarette smoke has been proven to be unhealthy.  You know, smoking is bad.  it's bad for everybody.  it's bad for the smokers.  it's bad for people near them.  On that regard, you know, for a long time in the States, we had, you know, and here in Japan too there are smoking sections in restaurants.  And while it seems like a good idea in theory, segregate the smoking area from the nonsmoking area and presumably smoke shouldn't transfer. In practice, you know it does.  In practice it means that you can't stop all smoke from seeping out and people sitting near the smoking area are definitely going to smell smoke.  I know that situation.  On top of that, it means that there's less room for people that don't smoke and we have to accommodate people that do smoke and I think people that do smoke should be accommodating people that don't smoke.  I don't think we should be worrying about them; they should be worrying about us.

Smoking should not be unilaterally banned in restaurants.  The question that you have proposed lacks very important issues that arise.  Laws, when implemented, need to be universal.  For a law to be universal, it needs to be implemented unilaterally.  If you say you cannot smoke in restaurants, what type of restaurants are you talking about?  Are you speaking of restaurants that have 50 people in it, 50,000 people in it, 1 million, or 1?  It depends on the size.  And furthermore, smoking is a constitutional right.  it's a part of the constitution.  Well, at the same time, it does not state that smoking is a constitutional right verbatim in the constitution.  Citizens of Japan are allowed to have daily...

Uhm, I partially disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants.  Although smoking has been shown to be a sort of cause of bad health for a lot of the citizens in which this sort of thing is happening, I think it's a matter of personal liberty.  So, if it's smoking – like if a restaurant wants to have a smoking section then that's fine.  That's the restaurant owner's decision.  I think you should leave it up to people to decide whether or not they wouldn't patronize such restaurants.  Furthermore, many restaurants have it both ways.  For example, many cafes like ‘The Tour' [***] have smoking and nonsmoking sections.  So as long as the sections are well maintained and actually take the smoke away from the nonsmokers...

No, I do not believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  A restaurant is there to serve a public need.  It is up to the restaurant to decide what the needs of its patrons are.  I believe that if a restaurant would like to offer smoking sections or be completely smoking, that is their choice because they are aiming at a certain clientele.  Obviously, their clientele are smokers. Further, and perhaps more philosophically, it is really the freedom of choice.  If people choose to smoke, they should do so if they want.  However, they should be – they should respect the air and the space of others.  So, a properly ventilated smoking area seems quite reasonable.  Those who do not smoke or worry about the effects of second-hand smoke do not have to visit that restaurant simply because they are probably not part of the...

Do I think smoking should be banned in all public places?  Yes, of course, I do.  Uh, for years, smoking was championed as a social – uh, social grace and – and a – a part of the – part of a social image of – of health and – and comfort and good – good looks and – and it has been proven finally that it is carcinogenic and it's cancer causing, and not just smokers can get cancer but those in the vicinity of smokers who happen to breathe second-hand smoke are also, uh, at risk of cancer.  So any – any public places are just places for the public to visit and going some place in public and having to be subjected to – to a carcinogenic cancer causing smoke is – is – is not acceptable.  If people want to smoke, they can smoke...
Whether smoking should be completely banned from restaurants and other public places is somewhat of a, uh, difficult question because personally I don't smoke and I believe smoking is a bad habit and can be very bad for your health and the health of those around you.  But on the other hand, I also believe that people have the freedom to choose, um, and so to restrict that freedom of choice for restaurant owners or, uh, the freedom of choice to operate their restaurant has – or how they make and also customers have a freedom to choose as well whether or not they would like to, um, go to a restaurant that allows smoking or not.  So, um, personally, uh, I – I don't like smoking and, uh, at these public restaurants but ideologically, uh...
So I agree that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants.  Smoking, first of all, is bad for your health and you can get a lot of serious diseases and smoking it just is, uh, bad for the environment and bad for everyone around you.  So if – if you are a smoker, it just doesn't affect you, it affects everyone that's around you, and by smoking in a restaurant, a restaurant is a public place where people go, and so it's not a decision that should be made by one person but a group decision.  Uh, smoking, uh, has known to cause many cancers and stuff like that.  So, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  I particularly, uh, don't like the smell of smoke, it kind of makes me, uh, feel bad, uh...
Without a doubt, I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants in – in this country.  Um, scientifically, it's been proven that passive smoking can cause lung cancer equally if not even more so than first-hand smoking.  Um, and – and with that knowledge, countries around the world have acted quickly in banning smoking from all public places, especially restaurants, um, and – and Japan has been very slow to act on this particular point.  Um, but I think basically what you are doing by allowing people to smoke and forcing people to – to go into passive smoking situation, um, it is essentially a death sentence for those people.  Um, and – and I think that's a terrible thing.  So definitely, um, smoking should be banned in those public pla – places or those places should have to provide a spec...
So I understand people's freedom to smoke, but I also understand people's freedom to breathe clean air.  I believe if somebody is smoking but they bre – but they breathe their dirty smoke into someone's clean air, then I understand the people who are complaining.  Uh, I don't think cigarettes are good for people and I understand people's efforts to keep them away.  However, if someone wants to smoke, then I think that there should be the necessary technologies that a person can smoke in a place where they are not exposing other people to their second-hand smoke.  I have seen in Japanese malls that they have smoking rooms where only smokers go inside and I think this kind of thing is can be very, very good and I – uh, and that should be fine.  However, I also feel that, uh, smoking is something that people should quit so if we can help...
Um, I believe that smoking should be publicly banned, um, as an individual wise, uh, I believe it should be limited basically to the home and second-hand smoke has been proven to be really dangerous to others.  So exposing others to that, um, is something of a public health concern.  So banning it in public isn't out of question, but as an individual wise, it's something that should be left up to the individuals in – in the privacy of their home.  Um, banning it entirely I don't think is reasonably possible, uh, just to ingrain [***] it in too many cultures but I do think that public ban is completely warranted and it's been really good for...
I wouldn't mind if smoking was banned from all restaurants in the country.  Um, it – it – it makes it a much more nice environment to go there, uh, and I think it sets a good example for kids when they – when they leave their home and they don't see all these smokers everywhere and the second-hand smoke is a – is a terrible thing and especially for kids.  And I can recall growing up in a – in an age where anybody could smoke anywhere and I think the world is a better place for having smoke-free places, and if it was made to happen everywhere all restaurants, I think that'd be a great thing.  Smokers don't need to smoke in a restaurant.  Uh, they need to kick that habit is what they need to do for the sake of their health and for the health of others.  Um, because it is kind of a contagious – second-hand smoke is a contagious thing and it affects other people.  So smokers should do it in the privacy of their own home or outside.
A medical research has shown that smoking is dangerous to many people, to the smoker, to the people around the smokers, to babies, to children, and it's dangerous to everybody.  So, I definitely think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and shops and pubs around the country.  Because I am British, uh, I have experienced this in England smoking is banned in restaurants already and people enjoy going to the restaurants much more because they have a smoke-free evening and they can taste their food better.  They can  --  they don't have a cough or a soared throat because other people are smoking and it is a lot healthier for the other people at the restaurant and also for the workers at the restaurant because the workers are exposed to smoke.
I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants across the country for many reasons.  The main one being the second-hand smoke is very dangerous.  I feel that a lot of people, including myself, do not like people smoking around us when we try to eat or drink.  It's very bad for the – it's very – very bad for your health.  It's very bad for the atmosphere of the place.  It would make the place look less friendly and less welcoming to people.  In my country, the Scot – Scotland, we do not smoke in restaurants and it has been very successful and it allows many more people to enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant.  Also, children around smoke is not a good idea for their – they have very small lungs and it's very dangerous for children to be around that level of smoke.  Also, it would increase the likelihood of people quitting smoking which would increase the likelihood of living longer which I think...
I am not in favor of the government or any other organization's attempt to ban totally the process of smoking anywhere.  I agree that smoking is bad for your health.  I agree that smoking has consequences that cause other people to have to pay more for healthcare and other items.  But the idea of regulating a person's behavior 24 hours a day something like in their own home even is ridiculous.  People have the freedom to drink alcohol and that's not good for you.  They overeat and have heavy foods and that's not good for you.  We don't try to ban eating.  We don't try to ban alcohol and banning smoking is equally bad.  Regulating it, restricting it...
I believe that almost all restaurants should ban smoking because it would be a health hazard for other customers in the restaurant, especially if they are children or people with bad health conditions of the lungs.  I have been to restaurants myself where, uh, smoking was not banned and I felt that I had a worst time there and the food didn't taste as good.  So therefore, I believe that they should ban all smoking from all restaurants in any country in the world that is why it would be better for all customers.  So you should ban all...
Um, it is difficult to understand what he said, uh, banned at all restaurants.  I am going to go with restaurants and – and interpret it as that.  Yes, I absolutely think that all smoking should be completely banned at restaurants across the country for the following reasons; uh, number one, it's totally disruptive to the other customers who may happen to be non-smokers.  Uh, number two, it's totally unhealthy for a wait staff, uh, who do not smoke and they're constantly exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke which causes multitude of various health problems.  Um, number three is just stinky and annoying, um, for a non-smoker to go into a bar or restaurants, uh, just to enjoy the food or the atmosphere and then to leave with all their clothes and hair smelling like cigarette to constant, um, source of annoyance for many people.  Many non-smokers in this country are...
I think it's a tough one to agree or disagree with this one.  I – when I lived in England then smoking was in place in bars and pubs and restaurants and then it became illegal for us to do it, but I have to say, you know, going out and working in these places or going out to enjoy then, it was actually really nice after you do not have the room full of smoke and not come home with your clothes smelling with cigarette and your hair and everything.  But in the same sense, you know, it's – it's a difficult thing, especially here in Japan.  It's a very different, uh, way of thinking here in Japan.  And here it's still allowed to generally smoke in [***] and bars and most of the times now I have kind of got used to it and it doesn't really bother me until I come home and then I realize how much of it I have smelled of it and how it's like clinging on everything.  And you know most of the times I don't really seem to notice, I think if I go back to England then I will really notice then, you know, to go out and...
I disagree that, uh, smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  I think people should have the right to smoke.  Um, however, that their right to smoke should not im – im – impinge upon the rights of others to enjoy clean air while they eat.  I think Japan has a balanced right in this respect.  Smokers, uh, often or in almost all cases, uh, can use a closed room within the restaurants, um, to smoke while they eat which is sealed off from other areas where non-smokers can choose to sit.  Uh, occasionally, this is not perfect to meet the – sealed section in the restaurant is – is not completely sealed and the smoke can go out to the other area where the non-smokers are sitting.  Um, but generally, I think it's a – it's a – it's an important public health issue, smoking, uh, that – and that secondary smoke which is the smoke that come...
I believe smoking should be banned in restaurants and all public places because there is a health risk of passive smoking.  I also think that smoking is rude because it smells and making up people breathe that smell is wrong.  In the same way, good hygiene should be practiced, uh, people should, um, always use deodorants to cut down body smells.  As for cigarettes, they are not just bad for people around and they are bad for the smokers themselves.  That's why they should be banned.  It's a dangerous people themselves [***], you know, ban alcohol, just get rid of it.  The only problem is sending the bad...
Yes, I think that it should be banned.  All smoking should be banned from restaurants.  The reason why I say this is because it's been medically proven that second-hand smoke really can affect others and it makes them sick and that even the second-hand smoke can cause cancer and the person that's actually smoking it can cause lung cancer and the people around them.  I remember growing up and going to restaurants and there'd be smoke everywhere, I would start coughing and feel like I start sick in my sto – stomach and being nauseas and I really disliked it a lot and now I understand that medically it's been proven too that second-hand smoke is even worse for you than for the first-hand smokers which is a terrible thing that first-hand smokers the same and he gets the smoke, but he doesn't realize that he is causing other people who don't smoke to get sick therefore it's terrible thing and I think smoking should just be banned totally.  I appreciate the fact that in America you...
Um, and again this question isn't so much of a personal opinion but rather a scientific one.  Um, I have another dumbfounded and why Japan allows people to smoke in public to the same degree that it has and that is something a little bit more characteristic of a Third World country where the tobacco industry has a hold of the government rather than other way around.  Uh, smoking causes a number of different health problems, not only for the smokers but for the people in the immediate vicinity.  So that includes restaurants, public parks, etcetera.  And there is a lot of people being affected by, uh, nicotine inhalation, tar from the cigarette, etcetera.  Furthermore, this isn't just a personal choice, it is a government's and social – and societal health issue.  The health insurance rates go up for people who are smoking.  They do not go up for the people who are living or being around somebody who smokes.  Uh, this is causing a – a drain on the – the economic system...
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants; one, because it is bad for the environment; two, because second-hand smoking is bad for other people's health; and three, because food cannot be enjoyed as much.  For the first reason, smoking is obviously bad for the environment as it produces, um, hazardous gas or I am sorry, chemicals; and for the second reason, second-hand smoking is hazardous to other people's health.  So if smoking is, uh – okay, the smoking is allowed in – at public restaurants, then other people have no choice but to inhale the second-hand smoke that comes towards – towards them.  And third, the people that prepare the food, um, would rather not have the people that are eating, uh, smoke at the same time that they are eating where they cannot – um, they will not be able to cherish the food as they are, smoking will ruin the taste and the smell will, um...
I just heard that some people think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and I could not agree more.  Basically, a restaurant is a public place which means that anybody should be able to go there and smoking is a health risk.  Personally, I have a young daughter and the amount of times I have gone into a restaurant and have to walk – had to walk out because it is filled with smoke.  Uh, it – it – it just disappoints me to think that part of society doesn't have access to places that they would like to go because other people have the right to pollute the environment with their cigarette.  I think that, um, if people want to smoke in their own homes, then that is okay.  That is their right but when they are coming to public spaces their health concerns that – uh, need to be dealt with and the government should make a policy so that it is not possible.
I disagree with this question.  Um, I do not think that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.  Um, it's mainly because, uh, I think people should have a choice.  I think a lot of people like to have the freedom to smoke in restaurants.  Um, although it is a public health hazard, I think if you are, uh, very concerned about the topic of – of second-hand smoke, then you can choose not to go to restaurants that allow smoking.  Um, I do think there should be separate smoking areas for people that want to smoke and – uh, and non-smoking area also for people that want to get away from the smoke, but I do not think it – it should be, uh, so extreme as to ban smoking in all – in all restaurants.  I think the restaurant owners should have a choice of having the restaurants as they like, including smoking area or not, and I think the – the customers should have the choice of choosing, uh, restaurant with the smoking area.
I don't believe that smoking should be completely banned despite the fact that I am a reformed smoker.  The reason I don't think that smoking should be banned is because prohibition has never worked respectively in the past.  For example, when alcohol was banned in America in the 1930s, an illicit trade doubled and this had, uh, links to organized crimes in the kids and provided greater social problems for America than the social problems sort to solve.  Therefore, I think smoking should be, uh, treated, uh, very carefully by government, and while it shouldn't be banned completely, I do think that the ban on publicity for tobacco companies should be brought into force and perhaps also a ban on sales by anyone other than...
I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned completely.  First of all, the reason is because of health.  Smoking produces a lot of poisons and toxic gases and, uh, that go into your body and it is bad for your health.  It also is bad for people around you who then have to smell that smoke that is not filtered – the smoke is not filtered and so it's bad for the health of other people as well.  Secondly, I see that the, uh, biggest reason why smoking should be banned is that it allows people to have – be better in their finances, provide finances that they don't have to spend, uh the – ¥400 a pack for each pack of smoke, uh, of cigarettes and so it provides more money for the family and it is better for their health.  It is also – it helps your breath to smell better and for you not to be, uh, sickening...
Uh, do I believe smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country?  Uh, most definitely yes.  Uh, smoking is a, uh, bad habit, and as an ex-smoker, I can say that the enjoyment of a meal does not depend on the ability to be able to have a cigarette.  Many other places have banned smoking in restaurants, California, Australia and there has been no economic decline in business in restaurants or bars.  Other places have gone further and banned smoking in cars or at home with little children, and there has been little decline in complaints.  On the other hand, there has been many benefits, less second-hand smoke, more enjoyment of food...
I still agree with myself, but like I said, I think smoking is annoying but if own a restaurant, you want to let people smoke in your restaurant, that's fine by me.  Uhm, it should really, like I said, as long as people doing it are adults and it's not bothering the other customers, you know, if you have separate smoking sections or whatever, then its fine with me.  Uhm, I would – if I had to choose between going to a restaurant where people can smoke in a very similar restaurant where they can't, I would choose the one where they can't, but that's just my choice and, uhm, yeah, I'm – I am fine with – with people smoking as long as I don't have to be around it too much and as long as it doesn't – doesn't give up a really sick smell like when everybody in the room is smoking, but again that's they are adults and I guess that's their choice.
Smoking should be banned at all restaurants and smoking should be banned in all public places generally.  I don't think smoking is appropriate in public parks or on the streets, anywhere where sm – other people can inhale the smoke.  It has been scientifically proven that the part – particulates in – in tobacco smoke especially have cancer-causing environmental impact.  Uh, some restaurants have tried to set up – setup separate areas for smokers and nonsmokers, but this is ineffective.  Uh, even viewing people smoking is – is bad advertising for – for other people.  Second-hand smoke is just as bad as direct smoke and – and therefore, public sm – smoking should be banned in all public spaces.  Although, I smoked for many years I – and used to...
Smoking should definitely be banned from all restaurants in the country.  The main reason is that it affects people's health in a very negative way.  People who smoke understand the risks and bad things that happen when smoking.  But, for the people who are exposed to their second-hand smoke, they are exposed to the risks as well even though they choose not to smoke.  This is why smoking should be banned from public places including restaurants. If people gave up smoking inside restaurants, the atmosphere would be much cleaner, more healthy, and would attract more customers to restaurants which would be a boon for the economy and for the restaurants themselves.  If people want to continue smoking at a restaurant, then we should create a private area or room where they can smoke or an outside area where they can go to smoke.  This way they can see their nicotine habits without destroying the mood created by their meal while also protecting the people around them in the restaurant...
Yes, I think smoking should be banned in restaurants.  You go into a nice restaurant with your friends or family, and if you yourself don't smoke or your friends and family don't smoke, then, you know, instead of enjoying a nice steak, you've got to enjoy the – the smoke of the man sitting next to you like you walk into a – a restaurant and it says nonsmoking and smoking areas, but there is no wall or anything dividing them.  It's all just sort of mixed together, so it just defeats the purpose.  Even the staff, you know, even if the staff don't smoke they have to stand in the smoke all day with their eyes and you know breathe in that second-hand smoke.  Second-hand smoke is worse than – than the actual smoke from a cigarette.  So, there is that point.  Also there is I've seen chefs smoking in the kitchen.  I don't think that's personally health and safety.  What else?  Uh, staff customers smoking, smoking in restaurants.  Smoking outside I think it's okay, on the streets anywhere is okay...
No, I don't think smoking should be completely banned from restaurants.  There could be an argument for it although; however, I believe that it should be maybe partially banned or smoking – separate smoking section allocated.  Also there's the – the argument that it could be discriminatory against smokers and where do you draw the line what is a restaurant and what is not a restaurant.  Is bar a restaurant?  Is a yata [***] a restaurant?  What is a restaurant, what is not a restaurant?  So, uh, again I think that no, not completely, possibly partially, although there is the argument, of course, for...
Smoking area shouldn't be eliminated from restaurants as long as they are kept on properly ventilated and properly removed from non-smoking patrons.  The smokers need a place to smoke and as long as they are not disturbing anyone else or disturbing the experience of the others in the restaurants, then they should be allowed to keep their area.  Without eliminating smoking from society as a result, it's impractical at the moment to ban smokers from restaurants.  There are still a very large segment of population in number of countries.  So, it'd be harmful to businesses to completely ban them when they can be safely segregated at the moment.
Yeah, I do.  I think they should be banned in restaurants, but at the same time if I'm a restaurant owner and I paid to build the freaking place, who is the government to say what I can and cannot do in my own restaurant.  That being said, studies have shown second-hand smoke is damaging to the people around them.  You know what I think you let that sort itself out.  If you allow people to smoke in your restaurant and people don't like it, people will stop coming and the people will decide you don't need a law.  But however for me I smoke and when there is people non-smokers around me I excuse myself in the table, I go outside because in the current you know society we live in I'm just uncomfortable smoking around non-smokers.  We're like the – the witch minority of the addicted public.  But yeah, you know it – it will sort itself out.  You want make a law, make a law.  I think in the future, it's just going to go that way, it's trending that way anyways.
I agree I think smoking should be banned in restaurants.  The main reason is that smoking or that is second-hand smoking has a direct impact on me.  If the person next to me at a restaurant is smoking, their – their smoke will affect me.  Either somehow my health or my cloths will smell or something like this.  For – for this reason – for health reasons, I think it should be banned.  However, I – I want to give people choices.  People are adults and can make decisions by themselves.  If they want to smoke they should be allowed to.  Therefore, I would recommend that restaurants have a separate enclosed smoking area for customers who want to smoke during their meals.  This way everyone wins.
I completely agree.  I think that smoking is a little bit too accessible here in this country.  You know I come from the United States where smoking has been, uh, progressively been – been banned, uh, in different states, in public places and I think it has actually helped reduce the amount of smokers in the country and that's certainly good for health.  It's also good for you know individual saving money.  I mean we all know that smoking has incredibly horrible, uh, uh, health side effects and not just in the – in the smoker, but also second-hand smokers which is the problem with having smoking in public places.  So, uh, I think it's important for the government to assist in banning smoking in public places.  Otherwise, uhm, individual establishments can't, uh, you know afford, they – they can't get enough clients because of...
Well, like I said before, uhm, I don't think it's important for people to – well for authorities to decide whether or not restaurants should allow smoking.  Uhm, I think that certainly you can leave to the market to decide.  Uhm, some restaurants a bit of smoke adds to the atmosphere I suppose.  Uhm, you know if you got people smoking, people having a good time, they don't have to go outside.  I think it sometimes makes a bit of a better atmosphere.  However, you know if you've got some nice food and someone blows a big load of smoke into your face you know you – that can make you a little bit angry and so you probably wouldn't go back to that restaurant.  Uhm, my dad used to smoke whenever we would eat dinner or you know go to the restaurant together or something like that.  He just you know go outside or go to the smoking area.  Uhm, so, I don't really think they need to – need to ban smoking that much.  They banned smoking in pubs in England, uhm.
I would agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants around the country.  People say that there're health hazards for both the smokers and – and people around who – who might be non-smokers.  Uh, it's also provides a non-smoke – a smoke-free environment, provides a – a healthier, more pleasant environment even for – for – for everybody concerned.  Uh, for the employees of the restaurants, it's – it's a lot safer since they've got a – they have left the choice of being in that environment.  So, um, yeah, smoke-free work places is lot better for them.  In the short run it might affect clientele and business for the – for the restaurants after ban is instituted, but in my experience the, uhm – the – the same old custom levels of, uh, custom come back...
So yeah, um, I think it's important for smokers to have a place to go to smoke and if smoking is completely banned, then they are, uhm – they're just left to smoke in their homes or maybe smoke outside in limited areas and, uhm, I think they have just as much right to want to be able to smoke in a place.  If – if it's allowed as people have the same right to not be in a smoking environment.  So no, I don't think smoking should be banned.  Uhm, it seems a bit too authoritarian and it seems too harsh.  Even though people make good arguments that you know smoking is bad and that it's not healthy, still the person choose to do it, they should be able to go into that environments and smoke.
There are many places in the world where smoking in restaurants or in public places is very illegal.  The purpose for this is because when people do smoke, not only are they being affected but the people around them who are not smoking are breathing in the second-hand smoke.  Second-hand smoke is just as dangerous as smoking in regular – uh, on a regular basis because it does harm your body and does cause cancer.  I think it should be illegal in all restaurants because smoking is a dangerous habit and it should not be around anywhere near the public.  Smoking is a very highly addictive drug, and it gives the drugs on account of it is addictive and it is harmful to your body, and it should be illegal in all restaurants and public places where there is a highly populated area.  There are times where people when they smoke, they affect everyone around them especially infants and...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants all over the country.  As I said before, it's healthier.  It's more pleasant and it would be – and it could save money in the end health-wise and, uh, smoker's uh, smoker's wallet per, um – personal finances.  Um, yeah, nobody – nobody likes to have smoke in their face when they are eating.  It's an unpleasant experience.  Uh, it's unhealthy for – for non-smokers to be breathing the second-hand smoke, especially if you're in a confined – confined area such as a restaurant, um, and if somebody wants to smoke, then he should just go outside to smoke.  They don't have to be fouling up the inside air to do it.  Uh, you know, and smokers might cut down on their smoking as a result.  They won't – they won't be allowed to smoke in restaurants so if that all...
Okay, round two, talking about nonsmoking in the restaurants.  Uh, like I stated before, I think, uhm, yeah, I mean I'm a nonsmoker.  I don't – and myself, I don't really - I mean if they ban smoking in the restaurants, I'd be happy.  Uhm, I don't like having to wash my clothes every time it smells like smoke and, uhm, I mean it's bad for your health smoking - I mean – I mean second-hand smoke is dangerous and then I mean, in Japan, there's a lot of second-hand smoke flying around.  It's, uhm, not so healthy I think, uhm, but as for how it would affects smokers, I mean, well, I'm sure they don't appreciate it, but I guess it could be, uh, I don't know if it has to be a complete ban of, you know, indoor smoking, but I mean – I don't know – I mean it's, uh, it would be great I think for...
Yes, as I was saying earlier that, uhm, smoking is bad, bad for your health, bad inside, uh, you shouldn't do it.  You should not do it in a restaurant at all.  I don't agree with it and it is kind of a problem here in Japan, let's be honest.  So, uhm, yeah, I think that we can do a lot of things differently.  We need to get that legislation through.  We don't agree with it.  We don't like it.  Uhm, yeah.  But having said that, on the other side of the coin, uhm, there is a case to say that it does add to the atmosphere.  You go into a nice bar here and you want to mingle with the locals and get that thrill feel of it, sometimes that smokiness can add to the atmosphere and people do enjoy that while travelling.  So I guess it just depends on a – the way you look at it, but there are certainly pros and cons but probably the latter takes, uh, from the former, if you want to get, ha, ha, technical but, yes, that's a lot of the main points about the smoking indoors and, yeah, I think that we can do a lot of...
Yes, I believe that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants because it's a public health hazard.  Smoking is very unhealthy.  It's ah, it's creates a, a cancer in the atmosphere that causes cancer for – for the smokers as well as non-smokers through second-hand smoke.  Smoking alters the flavor and taste of the food.  People no longer want to eat such, ah, good meals because they smell is terrible.  That's why you see in sushi restaurants often, ah, there's a no-smoking policy.  So, I figure all foods in all restaurants deserve that same high quality standard of a non-smoking policy to create and keep and preserve the wonderful tasting dishes that you can get, um, in most cities.  Smoking also makes restaurants filthy.  The walls get slimy and grimy from the pollution of the odorous causing fumes and filthy, filthy that um – terrible smelling smoke that comes from the cigarettes.  It's also bad for employees to smell it and they're constantly exposed to...
I think that smoking should be banned in all public places.  In the UK, smoking was banned in, um – in work places, and they said there are many fewer people smoking, um, and it will also lead to better health for their country because people will not be affected by things such as passive smoking.  When you smoke, you're not just harming yourself [***] or on time.  When you're smoke, you are damaging the health, risking the health of, um, the people around you including children and including people who work in the place where you are.  Um, the law in the UK bans you from smoking in anywhere which is another person's workplace, which is a person's workplace.  So, most effectively ban smoking in almost all public places including enclosed areas.  Um, I think that, um, smoking should be banned in all public places and not just in restaurants, um, and I should say that we should do this to, um, improve the health of the country.  We've known about the dangers about smoking for a long time now and there's no...
I disagree or yes, I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned completely in all restaurants in the country which is I'm assuming in this case Japan.  Where I come from in Canada, smoking is already banned in all restaurants.  You cannot smoke in restaurants.  I don't think you can even smoke in bars.  You have to go outside to smoke.  I think many people, even smokers, will agree that smoking is an unhealthy habit.  It damages your lungs and gives many people lung cancer.  So, such a habit should not be allowed in public restaurants where children and babies could be present.  I may be biased because I do not smoke.  However, I think even smokers will agree.  This is a habit that if you really need to, it's...
Smoking in restaurants is a public nuisance and people shouldn't do it, um, because of the health hazards and the – it, it imposes your will on other people.  Um, it's not a – it's not something that doesn't affect other people so especially in restaurants where you're at a closed atmosphere and the smoke will be going into other people's lungs and affecting other people trying to enjoy their meal.  Um, smoking should be banned.  I don't know if it should be in all restaurants.  Maybe you should just have smokers' restaurants where people only smoke inside that restaurant.  I think that would be something that would – somebody might want to make a sales point, smokers' restaurant and people who don't want to smoke don't have to go there or...
It's a – I disagree with that because by, um, um – by not legalizing smoke or cigarettes, what – what's going to happen with the cigarette companies that are out right now.  They're going to go broke and by taking out the cigarettes, the [***] department is going to be less and you got to think about that.  It's not like marijuana.  You don't get like a – you don't get any blackouts or anything by smoking.  It's just cancer in your lung.  So, I guess cigarettes should be just a – one of the hobbies like I said before.  It's not like marijuana or cocaine.  It's no – it's no drugs.
You know, I don't think so because a restaurant is a private establishment owned and operated by a private individual or individuals and I don't think that any outside, ah, or centralized authority should have a say in what those owners or operators, ah, allow their customers to do.  Ah, I do think that owners should be obligated to inform their customers of what kind of customers come into the establishment, smokers or non-smokers, but ultimately the decision should be up to the private individual and his establishment.  Ah, in addition, I think it's an unfair precedent to require this only at restaurants rather than of – of ah, other establishments like bars where the majority, if not all, of the, ah – patrons are smokers.  As you can see, this would have a harmful...
Um, I think it's perfectly reasonable, ah, to ban smoking in the majority of restaurants.  Nowadays, most people don't smoke.  I think it's only fair than taking account their taste.  Um also, ah, there is at least a theory that secondhand smoking is bad for the people working in restaurants and they've been exposed it constantly if they're working there.  I'm not convinced by the data myself, but I think it's fair to give them a benefit of the doubt.  On the other hand, I don't think it's fair to ban smoking in all restaurants.  I think there should be a small number, perhaps one in 10 or one in 20 that they're licensed probably by the police and the same with that alcohol selling premises are licensed.  Ah, a license to allow smoking.  That way smokers would have, you know, something like a private club they could go to and smoke if they wanted to and the people working there would not be obliged to work in that one place.  Surely, if there – if there's a minority of res...
I disagree that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants.  I think that as adults we're able to make our own choices in life.  It's not up to other people to decide for us.  As long as those choices are not affecting other people in the community, then there is no problem with making choices as adults our own choices.  As long as smoking areas are completely sealed off and it doesn't interact or it doesn't affect people in the non-smoking areas, then it should be absolutely fine.  So, once again, we are able as adults to make our decisions as long as they don't affect other people, then there should be no problem.  I do believe that children should be banned from the smoking areas, and it should have a no-child policy within those areas.
I think that smoking should definitely be banned from restaurants.  I mean the smell is off-putting.  People go to restaurants to smell the food, not the smoke, and uh, it's dangerous for the health.  People can, you know, get cancer from this.  They – they – they don't want to expose themselves to this.  It's not worth it.  It doesn't matter how delicious the food is, I think it's just not worth it to be inhaling the – the byproducts from – from cigarettes.  Customers won't come to the shop.  That's why the shops should consider banning all smoking; 85% of customers don't smoke, 15% of customers do smoke and I believe that they need to cater for this.  It's also parents, uh, will be happier to take their children to shop if there is, uh, no smoking and this would be a wise decision.  On a government level, the...
I think smoking should be banned in the restaurant, because you know, you want – I want to have, I'm a non-smoker and when I go to the restaurant, I want to have like a nice romantic dinner with candlelight and you know, just enjoying the evening.  I don't like to smell the – this disgusting smoke, you know and then, the – you want to sit there and enjoy the food and I don't know, once I smell the smoke, you know, this, I just, I can't eat and I feel sick and I – I – I feel like horrible and when you get home, your clothes are stinking and all this stuff it's like , yeah, I don't like it at all and um, I've traveled a lot more of European countries and in most of the European countries like, I don't know, like Germany, Italy, or other places, uh, you can't smoke inside anymore.  All bars and the restaurants, there're all, they banned totally smoking inside, just need to go out and I think it's good.  You know, people can smoke outside.  Nobody is bothered and they, you know, it's all good.  Inside, you know, like, you want to enjoy your food.  You want to have a nice dinner.  Then, there's a guy next to you smoking and it's...
Smoking should be banned in restaurants from – from a provider's point of view in that if the smoking people are obviously [***] to people, because they will be spending most of their time smoking.  On the other hand, sorry, not on the other hand, smokers will also drive away other customers from coming.  So, from an economic standpoint, having smoking banned in all restaurants is a good idea and what it also does is from the health perspective it forces smokers to rethink what they believe that their smoking isn't that important to them that they shouldn't – that they shouldn't smoke while they eat or smoke in front of other people if they're really, really in – they're really – really interested in continuing to smoke, they should be able to go to other places, other private places, and people [***] and also I think that smokers need to be much more aware of their own action and what that does to other people and everyone else in the environment and I think in Japan that...
Uh, no, I probably, wouldn't agree with the rule of banning smoking in all restaurants in the country.  Uh, that would be a little bit totalitarian.  Um, each area and each city can decide on its own rules depending on the people living there and – and what they decide, um, and what they're hoping for.  Uh, to ban smoking from all restaurants would probably upset many smokers.  Uh, the non-smokers would be quite happy; however, but we have seen in some cases cities banning smoking outside, um, but not actually banning smoking everywhere.  Uh, there have been some cases of cities banning smoking in restaurants only, but the restaurants have, however, built their own special smoking rules for this exception.
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants, because people do not want to come home smelling like tobacco.  They want to enjoy their food that they're eating, the drinks they're having.  They want to enjoy that peaceful ti – that time as a peaceful situation and not having to be feeling that they're going to be uncomfortable while they're there and their friends may not enjoy that smoking environment either.  Also, there are many – many cases of reports indicating that secondhand smoke can cause cancer and emphysema and other diseases not only in adults, but in children.  So, I think that – that smoking should be banned from all restaurants all the time, day and night.  Also I think maybe even that smoking should be banned from outdoors.
I think that smoking should be banned in every restaurant in the country, because I am not a smoker, and I find it disgusting to eat in an environment where there is smoke.  Sometimes you can't smell and taste the food properly, and it also makes your clothes smell and your hair smell and sometimes I wake up with a sore throat, and I can't speak properly from all of the smoke.  Uh, I believe there is a choice to smoke, so why do smokers get the choice when non-smokers don't get a choice about being in a smoky environment.  In the UK, smoke is – smoking is banned inside buildings, and I am used to this, so I find it very bad in Japan that it's still such – it's still so fine for people to smoke inside.  Um, I think everyone...
Okay.  So going off to my other point all right from before, I do disagree with this statement than, uh – I think it's, uh, as long as you have a closed off area for smoking, I don't think it would be such a problem, and you won't have to ban smoking from all the restaurants.  And even from restaurant marketing, I think it's good for the marketing, I guess not so much for the people, for customers, but from marketing point of view, you're not excluding whether there is smoking or non-smoking and so on.  I guess, from a marketing view, it's also good that it's – they shouldn't ban it, but I don't think it's really necessary to ban smoking from all restaurants.  Uh, I think it's just going a little over boiled with how people think about smoking.  Of course, smoking and secondhand smoking is bad, but...
Another reason why smoking should be banned in restaurants is that smoking is unhygienic.  The ash and the smoking air could reach the food that people eat.  And if the ash is in the food, that would be very dangerous for people to eat, and so it's good that – it would be better if smoking was banned in restaurants.  It's also smoking has a bad smell, and other diners will notice the smell of cigarette smoke on their hair, on their clothes, and it could affect their eyes, it could make the eyes water, and it is just antisocial smell to have in restaurants.  Smoking is in no way good for people's health, and it should be limited at most to, um, a priv – person's private home and should not be brought...
I personally don't like smoking but other people do.  And I would not agree with the statement that smoking should be banned from all restaurants.  Culture comes into this again, and just like in the United States, for example, when we go out to dinner, it's in a wide open dining room-type area, and if someone is smoking, you're gonna notice it; it's going to be in your face, it'll be in the air if they are near you.  But other countries like China is another good example.  Lot of times you're in a private room, so if you're smoking, you're affecting the people that are in that room.  And, you know, generally these are people you're acquainted with.  So, culture becomes an issue in this as well when we say, “Should it be banned?” No.  I – I wouldn't agree with that.  However, there should – if it's going to be allowed in a restaurant, steps should be taken to make sure that those that are smoking aren't...
I do not believe that smoking should be banned at all restaurants across the board.  I think that making a – a broad sweeping statement like that that includes all bars, restaurants, and other gathering establishments is severely limiting an option and actually curbing of personal freedom.  Now, I do believe that smoking is an unhealthy habit, but as any smoker or ex-smoker will tell you, it is also a highly social habit.  So, places such as bars and restaurants are in some ways ideal places, uh, for the habit to exist.  I would not make this the decision of an external body such as the government.  This should be at the owner's discretion and make the distinction clear whether the restaurant is a smoking or non-smoking establishment and people who choose to work there will be well aware of this before they go into employment at such a place.
I believe that there should be a complete ban on smoking in restaurants.  This is because non-smokers do not have a choice otherwise.  They are subject to the choices and manners on social etiquette of smokers who have total freedom to choose whether to smoke or not smoke in a restaurant with other customers.  These other customers do not have the opportunity to avoid cigarette smoke and, therefore, avoid going home smelling of cigarette smoke.  If smokers are banned from smoking within a restaurant, smokers still retain the choice whether they can have a cigarette or not.  They can leave the restaurant and smoke outside.  This...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants across the country here in Japan.  In my country, Australia, smoking has been banned in restaurants nationwide for more than 20 years now and I see and I think that data suggests that it has – it has had a definite positive effect on the health of the broader society and the enjoyment also of people who are eating in restaurants.  Of course, it also has an effect on children in the society.  The children's health is definitely affected negatively by being exposed to cigarette smoke as it is for adults who are breathing in second-hand cigarette smoke as well.  It's also important that we set an example for children not to smoke by having it restricted in such environments.  Also for the health of the broader society...
Uhm, yes.  I think that's a good idea.  Uhm, it become illegal for people to smoke in all public places in Canada, where I'm from, back in 2003.  I'm a nonsmoker myself and I don't feel that my lungs should be polluted by other people's sickening habit.  Their habit should be their problem, not other people's problem.  I don't want to die of cancer.  I think that's a horrific way to die.  I don't want to get emphysema.  Uhm, you know, with the – the way the density of smoke works, uhm, nonsmoking and smoking areas in restaurants don't work because what happens is the density of smoke ends up being equal all across a given room that one person is smoking in.  They can be on one side of the room.  What happens is the other side – all the sides of the room will have that same equal density of smoke and, therefore, everyone in the room will be affected by the second-hand smoke equally and I don't think that's fair and, uhm, a – as a nonsmoker...
I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and that is because the smoking – the smoke is not confined just to the person who is smoking.  It spreads out around them and – and can affect everybody who's in the restaurant and all of the people in the restaurant, I doubt, would be smokers.  So you're going to have a bad effect on a lot of the nonsmokers in the restaurant, and if you're a nonsmoker, it's rather unpleasant to have to sit in and breathe in somebody else's cigarette smoke.  When you leave the restaurant, you carry that smell with you and also, cumulatively it's going to have a bad effect on your health.  The effect may be small, but still it's a bad effect.  Uhm, if I'd been in the restaurant where people had been smoking, quite often, when I – I left the restaurant and went home, I'd want to change my clothes or even take a shower to remove the smell of...
There are some good points and some bad points about smoking, uh, in public places and many countries have already completely banned smoking in all public places, not only restaurants.  One is to protect the health of the employees, uhm, and it's very important to – to help those employees who were working in a smoking environment to – to protect their health, uhm, and also it's very difficult to make a smoking and nonsmoking sections in a restaurant because, of course, smoke travels in the atmosphere, so even if one is not smoking or is trying to avoid smoke, you cannot really do that.  However, I think smoking also adds to the atmosphere of certain kinds of restaurants, uhm, British pubs, for example, I think lost some of their flavor since smoking was completely banned and I think some izakayas also benefit from that kind of smoky boozy atmosphere.  Uhm, however...
I disagree with this statement because first of all it's really unhealthy.  It's really unhealthy for those who's actually smoking and the people around them, they get the second-hand smoking.  They decide not to smoke and yet, they get the smoking in their body – the smoke in their body because of the people who actually smoke, very unhealthy.  Uhm, another reason is the stuff that's in the news lately, the 2.5 particles.  Uh, it's really, really small.  It would get into your lungs and it will cost a great damage to our bodies so it should be banned.  And another reason is, uh, by doing so, it would increase the – health ratio, would cause less trouble for the – the medical system so I'd agree with the fact and it should be completely banned because...
Yes, I very strongly agree that smoking should be banned from restaurants as well as other public buildings as universities and council buildings.  Uh, it's just horrendous.  I – I'm a nonsmoker myself and I find that going into a restaurant that, uhm, has a smoker in it, I can instantly smell the smoke and I find it – it's difficult for me to breath and it's just a real put off for that restaurant myself and I'd rather go to a different restaurant.  Uhm and I'm sure that it effects the restaurant's profitability if people are getting turned away by the even just the smell.  And not to mention that the health risks for other patrons and the staff if – if there's a smoker in the room.  You know, the smoke – you tend to be closed and then breathing in the second-hand smoke which is – can be detrimental...
Ah, yeah, this is – this is a difficult question for me because I – yeah, I'm not a smoker myself but a lot of my friends are smokers.  We often dine together.  And personally, I don't really have a problem with it.  It doesn't bother me so much.  However, I think consumers do have options and if – if a restaurant is – is fully nonsmoking, there should – I am sorry, there should be restaurants that are fully nonsmoking and others that it's okay.  But that should be clearly stated on the – outside the door so the consumer has a choice which establishment to – to visit.  Other than that, again, there are a lot of studies that point to second-hand smoke being fairly dangerous and I wouldn't want small children around places where smoking is allowed so – as I suppose of establishments that serve alcohol and is more geared for...

I am a nonsmoker so I support a complete smoking ban.  However, I also sympathize with smokers' rights and I actually signed this.  I am partially in flavor of a separate area for smokers in restaurants but perhaps it shouldn't just be a smoker's area.  Perhaps it should be a completely different room.  Goodness knows how that could possibly be cost-effective but I – I think that smoking is greatly enjoyed by many and it kind of goes against civil liberties to completely ban people from enjoying something they love so much even though...

I believe it was Abraham Lincoln who said that your right to swing your fist ends where the other person's jaw begins and in this case this is a clear example of – of that playing out.  People have a right to smoke in their own homes or in private venues, but in public venues I do not believe they have the right to smoke in that, second-hand smoke is as harmful as it is to other people's health. Having said that, I believe that smoking should be illegal in all restaurants.  Even if you were to have a smoking section, it doesn't stop the problem.  If you were to quarantine them in a restaurant, sort of have walls built up around them, it also doesn't solve the problem of the waiters and waitresses who have to serve those people, getting exposed to second-hand smoke.  Now, some might say that those waiters or waitresses chose to work there and so they are exposing themselves.  But that is not the case in many – in our present economy, you know.  You take jobs that you can get for...

Frankly, I think it is perfectly reasonable to expect smoking be banned in most restaurants, the vast majority even.  Basically, most people nowadays I think do not smoke.  I think it's fair to say that even in a sample of different countries.  And, of course, there is also the issue of people working there – people working there exposed to second-hand smoke all the time.  And as we are not absolutely care how dangerous second-hand smoke really is, I think we need to give them the benefit of the doubt.  On the other hand, I don't think it should be banned completely.  I think that a small number, say 1 in 10 or 1 in 20, should be licensed probably by the local police in the same way that pubs are to allow smoking.  That way, people could go to smoke somewhere and the people who work there wouldn't be obliged to work at that particular place because there'd be plenty of other places they could work.  This, I think, would be a fair compromise between the needs of the smoker and of the nonsmoker, particularly the nonsmoking staff.

2003 when Canada illegalized smoking in public places like restaurants and bars and clubs and made [***]. I mean going to a club or a bar and having to smell other people's smoke really ruins the night.  Sometimes it's absolutely suffocating.  Second-hand smoke is very dangerous because there's no filter. [***] ...or somebody is smoking on the other side of the room, the density of smoke would be equivalent on the – onto the other side of the room as it is to the area right around the smoker.  That's just the way smoke works so that a person sitting right beside a smoker would get the second-hand smoke just as badly and across the room. We shouldn't have to be smelling any smoke at all, and so having a nonsmoking section doesn't really help any because the smoke comes over from the smoking section.  If you are walking to the washroom and you pass by the smoking section, you can smell that and that increases your chance of getting lung cancer.  it's not fair.  It definitely should be illegal. [***] ...people who aren't even smoking.  it's ridiculous.  Why do we...

I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country for several reasons.  One is that it smokes – it smells bad and other patrons in the restaurant may not be able to enjoy their food without the – without the smell of the cigarettes.  Also, it looks bad to see somebody eating to – to be – to have to eat while somebody else is smoking.  The last reason is that it's very unsanitary having ashtrays and cigarette smoke.  After the person is done smoking, somebody from the restaurant has to clean it up and they may not clean well enough so that other customers may have health issues as a result.  For these reasons, I think cigarette smoke should be – smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country – in every country.  it's not – not good for anybody's health, so there is no reason for it.  If someone –

Okay.  Round two, talking about nonsmoking in the restaurants.  Like I stated before, I think – yeah, I mean I'm a nonsmoker.  I don't – and myself, I don't really – I mean if they ban smoking in the restaurants, I'd be happy.  I don't like having to wash my clothes every time it smells like smoke and I mean it's bad for your health, smoking.  I mean – I mean second-hand smoke is dangerous and then I mean in Japan, there's a lot of second-hand smoke flying around.  it's not so healthy I think.  But as for how it affects the smokers, I mean, I'm sure they don't appreciate it but I guess it could be a – I don't know if it has to be a complete ban of indoor smoking but I mean – I don't know.  I mean it's a – it would be great I think for...

Smoking is gross.  It smells bad.  it's been clinically proven to be unhealthy for you to both being the smoker and to inhale cigarette smoke.  it's even been proven that cigarette smoke clinging to clothes can cause health problems.  Cigarette smoke is bad.  And as someone who doesn't smoke, I don't feel like I should ask you to accommodate people that do smoke.  You know, even if there are areas in restaurant – even if there are areas in restaurants that are separated so that one area you can smoke, one area you can't smoke.  Even then, there are less seats for nonsmokers.  Nonsmokers are inherently accommodating smokers and that shouldn't be the way it is.  Smokers should be worrying about accommodating us.  They should be worrying about us putting up with them, not the other way around or they should – yeah, yeah.  They should, yeah.  We don't have to worry about putting up.  Right.  So the point of all this is, is that, you know, even if you can separate them, smokers are still imposing on non...

Smoking should not be unilaterally banned in restaurants.  I think smoking should be banned unilaterally everywhere.  Smoking is bad.  Smoking is a bad habit.  I think everybody should still smoke – not smoking any tobacco.  Tobacco has a lot of nicotine and tar and other carcinogenic substances.  In the United States, there are some states that legalized marijuana.  I think smoking marijuana is far less unhealthy than smoking tobacco.  So, henceforth, the question that you are asking is about – I think is implying that whether or not we should stop or ban tobacco smoking in restaurants.  I propose we should smoke other things or should you smoke nothing.  The question that you are proposing is lacking many parts to it and hence it is difficult to answer.  Are you...?

I partially disagree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned from all restaurants.  For example, in America in a lot of states there's been a complete smoking ban in all restaurants and even though it's been a boon to public health, I think that it would – it's a matter of personal liberty.  So, if a restaurant owner wants to have a smoking section in his restaurant, then I see no reason why he or she shouldn't change that for anyone else.  Furthermore, there are restaurants that have it both ways.  For example, restaurants like ‘The Tour' [***] have a smoking and a nonsmoking section.  So, as long as the smoking section is filtered to a manageable extent, and I see no reason why restaurant owners shouldn't be able to do that to give customers the choice to patronize or to not patronize so...

No, I do not believe that – that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  Restaurants are there to meet the needs of its patrons.  If the restaurant chooses to offer smoking availability to these people, then that is their target market.  Those are the people they are trying to attract.  Therefore, they should offer smoking either in a well ventilated smoking area or perhaps in the entire restaurant.  More philosophically on this question, it's about freedom of choice.  Some people choose to smoke, some people choose not to.  Some people choose to go a restaurant that allows smoking, some people choose not to.  If people are worried about second-hand smoke, then they should not choose the restaurant that they have chosen.  it's really quite simple.  That – that restaurant is looking for patrons that enjoy to relax over a cigarette.  If you are a nonsmoker, then you would obviously choose a different restaurant which can serve your need.

Smoking is a – is a health determent, is carcinogenic; carcinogenic means it is cancer causing or is associated with cancer.  Smoking in a restaurant is – is uncomfortable for the people around them as it's not just smokers who are affected by the carcinogens in – in this tobacco smoke but those who breathe second-hand cigarette smoke are also subjected to the same carcinogens and – and effectively being introduced to cancer causing substances.  So, of course, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  If people wish to smoke, they can smoke in the privacy of their own homes or their cars, some place where the public aren't in close proximity.  Uh, smoking should basically be banned altogether.  I don't say – there is no need for tobacco smoke to be...
Whether smoking should be allowed at restaurants around the country I believe, um, is a matter of choice and personal freedom.  I don't smoke.  I don't like smoking.  I believe it's not healthy.  I believe it can, uh, be, uh, negative – have negative effects to the people around us.  But, um, on the other hand, I can't agree ideologically that, um, I am restricting the freedoms to choose of what kind of place the restaurant or, um, the owner would like to have or the customers I believe also have a right to choose – freedom to choose.  So, if they don't want to go to a place or support a place that allows smoking, then, um, they, uh, should not go to those places.  But I – uh, although I don't like to go to those restaurants where – um, that smells really smoky, I think...
So I agree that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants.  First, smoking is bad for your health and it is known that many kinds of, uh, smoke cause different kinds of cancers, um, and smoking is not a decision that should be made by yourself, it should be made by a group.  Uh, restaurant is a public place so if people that go to restaurants don't want to smell, uh, people smoking, um, smoke, uh, also has a very bad smell, um, smoking should be done, uh, outside if it's something that you want to do, uh, but yeah it is known to be very bad for your health.  I think that smoking in restaurants is, uh, caused, uh, many, uh, bad arguments and it's just bad...
Well, a restaurant is a place where people go to enjoy a meal, um, and that's a meal nothing else.  Um, of course, atmosphere is – is important in that – in that experience and, um, currently in Japan a lot of atmospheres in restaurants have been spoiled by smoke, um, and thick smoke.  I think exhaust fans are not working.  Um, and – and so many places that I go in this country I walkout after a meal stinking of smoke.  It's been proven scientifically that second-hand smoke can cause lung cancer, and if we go and eat out multiple times a week, we'll certainly have the risk involved in – in – in potentially developing lung cancer in the future increases, and I think that's unfair on people who just want to go out and enjoy that meal.  We shouldn't have to put up with the risk of potential health risk, um, from...
At the restaurants though I don't think smoking should be a legal there because when people are trying to eat their meal, I think the smoking can get in the way.  Even I think smokers themselves, if they are smoking, they can't taste their meal so well.  There's nothing wrong with people smoking outside or somewhere where people can smoke, but people who are trying to eat, they shouldn't have to have smoke, uh, in that situation so they can't even taste their own meal.  Uh, at restaurants, smoking should be completely banned and people should smoke outside if they want to smoke.  That's how they do it in America.  In Japan, people are smoking inside.  I don't like that at all.  However, I think they feel if they go outside the smoke the space is too small that their smoking gets in somebody's way outside.  So America people are smoking outside, but it's a huge space and...
Banning smoking in the restaurants is completely reasonable.  It's a public health matter and while I don't believe cigarette should be banned, um, privately, in public spaces where a person's smoke has the chance to affect others.  It's not – uh, it's not good.  So pub – banning – um, public restaurant smoking or ban in restaurants is a – is a reasonable – reasonable action for a state.  It's of public health concern.  So, I am completely for ban in restaurants, smoking.  Privately is another matter, but...
I am all in favor of smoking – uh, smoking ban in restaurants all across the country.  I think, uh, second-hand smoke is quite a terrible thing, especially for kids, and to be able to go to a restaurant and have a family go there without being air smokers or seeing that or smelling that – those bad habits, would be a good thing.  Um, I don't think it affects restaurants adversely.  The customers still need food.  They still want good food and they'll do – they will go to a restaurant, whether they smoke or not.  So, I think smokers should smoke at home or outside, or at some place where it's legally designated all right to do so.  Um, and smoking should just it's a – it's a old habit that should just go away and the more we clampdown on it the better.  So, I am all for it because it affects other people from a distance unlike other bad habits people might have.
It's a scientific fact that smoking is proven to be dangerous for everybody, from the smokers to the people around them, to unborn babies to everybody.  So, I think it's very important that smoking is banned in restaurants because it's dangerous for the people in the restaurants and also for the workers in the restaurants.  And I live in England, I am from England where people are not allowed to smoke in restaurants and it's so much nicer to go out for dinner and enjoy an evening with no smoke.  It means your clothes don't smell, your hair doesn't smell, your food taste better, and – and people enjoy it a lot, lot more.  Um, and it's also healthier for the workers, because if they spend the whole evening surrounded by people who are smoking, then obviously that's very unhealthy for them, um, and – and it's – it's not good for them at all.
I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout the country.  It would be a great improvement on people's health and happiness if smoking to be banned.  It is also – it would make the restaurants seem more inviting for the lack of smoke in the air.  I would also help – it would also help people's lungs and health.  Children are very susceptible to many different diseases when they are young, and with the smoke, it would then have more damage on their lungs.  In my country smoking is banned in all restaurants.  It works very well and it increases, a, everyone is happiness within the restaurants.  The smokers are also very happy and most of them are very happy the fact that they don't have to worry about being in certain areas, the smoke – smoking area or a non-smoking area.  And I feel that it would make everyone a lot more...
Smoking in restaurants should not be totally banned because people are people and they want to have a smoke after they eat.  They should be able to in a specific part of the restaurant.  Now restaurants can do more to segregate that population so that the smoke does not come into areas where people don't want the smoke, don't want to be a part of their eating experience.  So that's up to the owner and up to the establishment and places where they do it more separately will get more business than places where they don't want.  Uh, but banning I just don't like the idea of any government regulating people's behavior in such ways that they don't have a choice.  Um, human beings can make up their own minds.
I believe that smoking should be banned from all the restaurants because it is a health hazard to other customers while eating at a restaurant and there are people smoking besides you or near you, it would be very bad for our health but it'd also be bad for the taste of the food because you are smelling the smoke from other people.  And if you had lung problems or little children, it would be very bad for them while smoking through.  That is why I believe that smoking should be banned from all restaurants.  Not even a small section with smoking but they should be banned from all restaurants in all places in the restaurants as well.  That way the air would be cleaner.
I believe that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, uh, in the country for the following reasons, um, number one, I believe it's source of, uh, great annoyance and discomfort to any customers who are non-smokers, um, when they are exposed to, uh, the cigarette smoke of their – other patrons at the bar – number – at a restaurant.  Number two, it's totally unhealthy for the staff.  They are unnecessarily and unintentionally exposed to cigarette smoke – second-hand cigarette smoke all day for their work which causes the multitude – which has been proven to cause the multitude of health problems.  Number three, smoking is, uh, rather disgusting and unhealthy habit.  It should not be promoted, um, in public spaces.  It should only be, uh, feasible – oh, not feasible but it should only be done I think in, um, specific...
Well, I think in restaurants, it's really not enjoyable to have cigarette smoke when we go there so as to enjoy the atmosphere and/or the food and the whole new experience of it is to smell the food and basically and you can't really do that if there is cigarette smoke in the air or there are people smoking near you or the smell of ashtray is everywhere.  And you know especially here in Japan, it's really quite annoying sometimes if you don't really want to be around there or if there is no really area for you or if you keep everybody out of the restaurant and bars, I feel then you will see more people standing outside smoking on the side of the street, and you know that's going to cause more litter and you know there have to be more dedicated areas for people to smoke.  Otherwise, they are just going to smoke whatever they want and then you know leave the cigarette butts over and then you are still going to be smelling smoke when you are walking around maybe outside places and it'd not be as enjoyable or as I...
I disagree that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  I think Japan has a balance right at the moment when it comes to smokers and non-smokers in restaurants and most restaurants have a sealed section where smokers can elect to sit and the – there is another area where non-smokers can sit if they do not wish to be bothered by – by cigarette smoke.  Um, it's important however that the sealed section is properly sealed and that the smoke cannot escape and waft into the non-smoking area.  Um, important for a couple of reasons the – for the enjoyment of the patrons who are non-smokers and also as a public health issue with – we know that secondary smoke that is smoke that comes from the lit end of the cigarette is very harmful, um, to the people who breathe it in and, um, it does but we should not put at risk because of the actions of others who may choose to smoke.
Smoking should be banned in public places because if people have to breathe the smoker's smoke, it's a health risk and it's annoying in the same way people should have good hygiene and cut down on their body odor.  Um, certain mall they should just take it off the street.  Smokers litter, throw their butts everywhere.  However, I think people should have the freedom to smoke.  There should be smoking areas, smoking rooms, so they should be fined if they litter.  In the same way if someone has terrible body odor, they should be forced to deodorize, to shower.
I believe that smoking should be banned for restaurants.  Second-hand smoking has caused cancer, it has caused illnesses, and it has been medically proven that it would hurt people.  The first-hand smoker gets the two.  The second-hand user doesn't and therefore it is wrong for smokers to be smoking in a public area where other people who do not smoke have to sink it in into their body and then get sick.  I think that it's really, really important to have restaurants around the world who choose to not have smoking in their restaurants.  I have a 7-year-old daughter and I really have a hard time in going into the restaurants that has smoking.  It makes her sick, it makes me sick and the first time the first smoker they just don't realize because they are used to it, but they themselves are probably going to have lung cancer and going to die from it.  So, we have a choice, we don't smoke and we don't...
So as I was saying that, um, you know this is a big societal and, um, uh, you know government-related health expense that people are not simply making the right choices for themselves or the people around them.  Um, humans are not always the best decision makers and when certain members of society are – are not able to make decisions that are able to benefit their own lives and the lives of those around them, the government ought to step in and help them make those right decisions.  And the banning of smoking in public places is a measure that many countries have taken long time ago and I do believe that it's about time for Japan to get onboard.  Um, I was so surprised when I moved here and you know saw people smoking in restaurants, I haven't seen that in years in the United States and it's been a huge help for, um, the, you know, healthcare cost and some of the national, um...
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants – restaurants because; one, it is bad for the environment; two, because second-hand smoking is hazardous to other people's health; and three, because food cannot be enjoyed as much when there is smoking around.  For the first reason, smoking, uh, it means a lot of hazardous chemicals that are definitely bad for the environment and it should be banned not only at restaurants but, um, public places.  And two, because second-hand smoking is inevitable for the people that are inhaling the smoke, um, around them and, um, it is also cancerous.  And for the third reason, because the people that prepare the food at the specific restaurants, they would rather not have, um, people smoking and eating at the same time where the smoke and the – um, the smell of ash will ruin the taste.  Um, so I think that smoking should be completely banned, um, at all restaurants for the health...
I don't think that anybody should be allowed to smoke in the public place and restaurants are public place, so there should be a full smoking ban.  The government should issue this that it should be written in law because it is something that places people's health at risk.  People who smoke pass on second-hand – pass on, um, life threatening – no, not illnesses I suppose but they can create illnesses.  They put other people's health at risk and it shouldn't be allowed to happen.  Personally, when I go into a restaurant and I smell cigarette, uh, I walk out and I don't think that it's fair that I should have to walk out because I feel that I should have the right to go into any restaurant without fearing for my own health and I should be able to take my young daughter as well.  But unfortunately, it is not possible in a lot of the restaurants in Japan and I have had to leave many times in...
I strongly agree – strong – excuse me strongly disagree with this topic.  I think that, uh, all restaurants in the country should not ban smoking.  It's mainly because I think, uh, both customers and restaurant owners should have the choice, uh, and freedom to choose what kind of restaurant they would like to have, uh, in – including the restaurants that they can smoke in.  Um, I do think there should be a separate smoking area for people that like to smoke but I don't think it should go as far as banning smoking in all restaurants.  Um, if people, uh, are concerned about the topic of second-hand smoke, they can choose to go to restaurants that do not have smoking areas.  On the other hand, if people are not so bothered, they can go to places that have a smoking area.  So, I disagree with this topic.  Um, I don't think that they should go far as having a countrywide ban in all restaurants.  Um, there is also the topic of health for the employees that work there, but I think – I think that's a separate thing.
A lot of people think that smoking ought to be banned, but I don't believe that it really works in practice because all that happens is that smoking goes underground and a lot of people, uh, will buy cigarette from organized crime gangs who can provide this in bulk and who will be, uh, unmonitored by, uh, police forces and, uh, operate usually using extreme violence.  Um, other than, uh, a general balanced smoking, the ban on smoking in public places does work and lot of people, uh, do keep to these bans basically because it's very difficult to resist, uh, being, uh, told by the owner of an establishment that you have to extinguish your cigarette or cigar all types therefore...
Yes, smoking should be banned in restaurants because it is very rude to be in a restaurant if you don't smoke and to have people nearby who are polluting you and poisoning you through their smoking.  So, it's very rude.  Secondly, um, smoking is very dangerous.  It can kill people.  The smoke, uh, puts, uh, tar in the lungs, as well as many poisons in the body.  It's not good for adults.  It's not good for children.  And then smoking is a financial hazard to many people's lives as they have to spend so much money, but in the restaurant, um, it is a bad place for people to have to endure smelling smoke, uh, something they don't like – restaurant should be a clean place and smoking should not be permitted.  Uh, uh, the smoke in the restaurant affects the food and so it is not good to have smoking in a restaurant because it – it makes...
Do I believe that smoking should be banned in all restaurants?  Yes, I do.  There is no positive side to smoking besides [***] these smokersf addiction.  As an ex-smoker, there is no less enjoyment as, uh, for smoking or not smoking in a restaurant.  Most people are quite comfortable to go outside and have a cigarette if they feel so.  On the other hand, there is no economic loss to the provider of the food, i.e., the restaurant or bar.  Other places have banned smoking, and there has been no dramatic income loss felt by everybody.  People have used this as motivation to quit smoking or cut down on smoking.  It's also become much easier and much more family friendly for non-smokers and families, much more comfortable...
