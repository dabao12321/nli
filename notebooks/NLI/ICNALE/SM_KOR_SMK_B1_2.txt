Um – uh – I think that smoking is very harmful to our body, so I hate smoking because cigarette contains a lot of bad materials.  Especially, cigarette may cause various disorders.  For example, cancer, yeah.  If possible, we would do well to not smoke.  Thank you.

I didn't smoke and my people also didn't smoke, but smoke is – people should have – shouldn't have – uh – free... free... free advice about active, so they... smoking people, they have... they didn't [***] didn't smoking people.  If they do, they have to – they say – they have to smoke but they did not.  If they did not, no problem.  They...

I disagree the banding [***] smoking, country banding smoking action because I am a heavy smoker.  Smoking is – smoking – they need to easy and comfortable, so many people do the smoking that they get a freedom, so I think that smoking is not banding the country action.  We...

Yes, smoking is very bad habit for smokers.  Always harm – harm too many people include – including – including his healthy, so many place have a smokers zone, but a lot of smoker do not – do not keep that caution as many people...

I – I agree, think, smoking is very bad.  So I think people don't smoke on the street or in a restaurant, in a school, in a toilet, in the park, etcetera.  Smoking, I – I hate smoking.

Uhh – I agree to smoke because that is a free life.  Uhh – people – person have [***] then no smoking is not healthy, but people can't smoking comple...

I agree, because many people hate smoking, because smoking is – stressed my body, but my body to have effort, effect.  We think – we need to think many people's profit, so smokers is new to non-smoking.

I think first –oh, no.  I think this very uncertain because I know smoking is very harmful for us.  However, smoker is also have a right to smoke, so I think this [***] maybe – maybe government can make place, specific place to smoke, and then smoker can smoke only at their – so I think this topic is a little [***] for smoker.  So I just want to say again smoker is also have a right to smoke.

I disagree to that opinion.  In the restaurant there is not only – there is –there – there exist a smoker – uhh – but smoking is his or her – if – if smoking is bad – if then the ban – then ban – banned then the smoker should – should as a smoker can't do smoking.  So I don't agree – I don't agree to that point.  I think smoking was – was [***] and smoker should smoking and [***].

In my opinion I – I agree – I agree thoroughly in restaurant smoking because smoking is bad action.  Smoke comes to – to study and non-smoker people doesn't like smoke.  Smoke makes bad feeling and lot more and of course smoker is wanted to be smoke in restaurant.  So, smokers must think other people not only – not only – only self thinking.  Smoker is not good, so I think in a restaurant and...

I agree that some country should ban – should ban smoke [***] country global trend is – so prohibition of smoking address countries at Japan, Europe, and United States, in Greece, France to smoke tobacco in order to ban smoking.  [***] people see advertising company for tobacco, so consumption of the – increased, so some countries ban...

Smoking provides people with [***] for example, my smoke father died long, long disease.  And when – when – when – when I was in army I also have long disease and smoking comes to many people and smoking...

Yeah, I agree that – I agree to that that smoking – that smoking smell makes some disease like cancer or something like that, so sure, they – who a – who may – who may – who smoke – who do smoke – smoking people have a right to smoke in the restaurant, but the more important thing is the not smoking – not smoking – no smoking people also have a right to – to – to not smell – to not smell the smoking.  Yeah.  And...

I disagree with the statement.  Actually I smoke sometimes, but that when I get stress a lot, smoking less my stress, and if – if I could not smoke – when I get very sad or depressed, I have no one to take care of me, but smoke is very [***] by to my feeling – to make better.  And if there are a lot of people for example, restaurant, it would be bad to...

I also banned smoking – I also banned smoking because smoking smell is very bad.  And smoking is not good to health.  Smoking cause cancer and lung cancer and – and so on diverse disease.  So smoking person and...

I don't disagree with this statement.  I – I think it is a discrimination to – to smoke, smoke people.  Uhh – the reason is smoke – to smoke is individual preference I think.  So they are respectful...

I think smoking – I think banning off smoking of all the area is not proper because we live in the democratic country, so everyone's freedom should be – everyone has their freedom, and we can choice their way, or – and behavior, so – so restrict – restricting someone's behavior is not the proper way.  And I think it's a matter of choice, matter of choice and responsibility, so the smokers have – can – can choose their smoking place and...

I always will be smoking because it's the will of the individual smoking and personal choice.  Recently, many non-smoking and smoking place have been specified, so – so the smoke gradually disappear from the street.  People also consider smoking as a negative, so a lot of people also trying to try smoking.  Now that smoking is not right or wrong, smoking should be considered with selection of a person.  Smoker will also be [***] also [***] this gradually and health – healthy society will occur automatic...

I disagree that – I disagree with the argument because the figure is very, very good.  So in – so the smoking person – smoking person personal harm any [***] don't smoke, so in a – in a way not to harm non-smoke person, the smoking person is permitted to smoke because cigarettes are favorite food.  The important thing is the smoking person does not harm, so...

I don't smoke and I did not smoke because smoke is harmful for people.  So I don't agree smoking, so I want – I want to – want that people must not smoke.  That is my opinion.  Aah...

I think – uhh – I agree with the statement.  There is a – there are several reasons to support my opinion.  First, when people support banning smoking from restaurant and other public places why I think it is the right of person's personal life.  Second, people have the right to clean air or people also have the right to [***] most.  Restaurants and other public places should accommodate the right, so I – to ban smoking would be the same as banning smokers, which is radical discrimination, which is the reason I am agree with the statement.

I agree with the statement because I strongly agree this statement.  I hate person who smokes because smoking is very harmful and it's not good, it's bad, because smoking causes many cancers – cancers and not good for our body.  And even though some people like to smoking – people can cause cancer too.  It is very, very bad and smoking is not only not good for their body but also not the smell is very bad because smoking person has always very...

I agree the opinion.  I disagree to smoking in public.  I can understand smoker's opinion.  Mainly they want to enjoy it anywhere they are.  But they have to stop smoking in public for everyone.  I think smoking in public is very rude because it causes bad effect on other people's health.  In my case, when I pass by some smokers, I feel stuffy and I can't breathe well.  I think if people have like to have – smokers in public are ignoring our right, so I don't agree to smoking...

I agree that smoker or completely [***] ban – uh – places [***].  Um – uh – first – uh – cigarette has got a lot of environment – environmental destruction.  Um – and cigarette create a lot of exhaust [***].  Um...
I disag – uh – I agree with the topic – uh – because when you smoke in the restaurants it can cause harm [***] to people who won't smoke, but I disagree to ban country because smoke – smoke is – uh – can – uh – stress up and I think it is the one of – one of [***], so I agree with the restaurant and smoke, but I disag...
Uh – I agree this – with the statement.  Um – I'm not a smoker and I am a woman, so later I have a baby with my husband – um – especially women must not this smoke through smoking, but must not [***] the cigarette or whatever.  It's really bad for her health and her baby – uh also – uh smoker is – uh – smoking is bad for non-smoker because...
I think smoking should be banned, because there are – uh – a lot of – uh – atmosphere pollution and some people get breath – breath – uh – uh – breath sick, so they have to ban – they have to ban the smoking and also there are some – they are smoke – smoke and there are some – lot of bad things, so they have to ban smoking.  Um – um smoking is not good for their healthcare, so the country have to ban...
I am going to same and because smoking is bad or has that – that – that is – that is worsen – worsen your health and it is – it is not good – good – this is not – this is not good – this is not good well and you have to – we have to – we have to ban – ban smoking – ban smoking and I don't know...
Whether smoking in public places should be banned or not about this topic I guess I agree with the idea ‘cause I am a nonsmoker person so – and the main that's probably the first reason and the second one should be relating to the fact that it could lead the second smoking effect which is very hazardous for other people so I kind of respect smokers' rights, but I don't think harming other people by providing second smoking kind of thing is very rather rude of them so...
I agree with this statement.  I – I don't like – I don't like smoking and I don't want my friend – my friend – my friend smoke on the road or – or in – in university anywhere.  I don't – I don't like – I don't like the – I don't like to smoke – to smoke – smoke into my – my mouth and – and that's very unhealthy.  My father – my father – my father stopped smoking – smoking when my mother – when my mother pregnant with me and so – so...
I live in the country with the freedom so I don't think that it is proper to ban the smoking in entire country.  People have freedom to smoke even though smoking is bad around the people but actually they pay some tax because of the harmness of smoking so the most important thing is how to spend the tax from the smokers.  If a country used that tax properly and build or made some walls to prevent the harmness of smoking around people I mean the -- 
Smoking – ban – banning of smoking is not appropriate.  I – I don't agree about that because smoking – a real smoking is not good for health but not too much smoking is not seriously bad for health and many people have freedom – many people have right to – to have freedom so their rights should be protected, so smoking – banning of smoking is not appropriate and they – with smoking people can reduce stress or – or else maybe so...
Preventing the smoking in the all area is inefficient.  I think there are two group of people one is smoking people and two – second is not smoking people.  By the way preventing the smoking in the all area is not fair to the smoking people.  That's why I think smoking is just favor of person just like eating ice cream and [***] for – or wearing some unique cloth – clothing and so on so...
Smoking is very – smoking is very bad.  Health is very important for – for us.  Smoking – smoking – smoking for smoke – if – smoking is for bad for me and my par – my – my family.
I agree that smoking is very bad.  I hate smoking because it smells disgusting and it's harmful to smoker and people who aren't smoked.  We always hear how smoking is bad so I don't know how explain the smoking's disadvantage.  Smoke is bad for smokers and smoker's family or smoker's friends so I think smoking is very, very bad things.  Thank you.
I agree with that because when we go to the – when we go to a public – public – public – public – public – public – public restaurant or somewhere so they – there are smoking people or not smoking people.  Well, I think it's good because nonsmoking people doesn't want to smell smoking – smo – smoking ash and they do want but they – they are public place so...
I think selling – I think selling cigarettes for – for the nation people and for their people is – is just same as selling drugs for whatever.  And, first of all it's not good for health not for only – not only for smokers but also all the public – public health.  Second hand smoking is just bad as – just as bad as for just smoking yeah and it is well stated statistics is proving it as I know and...
I agree about the argument but I hate smokers and maybe it's some people think my answer is rubbish but I don't care I really, really hate smokers and second, already you know smoking – smoke is not good for our health and smoke – smoke makes bad for indirect smoker and indirect – no – no – no – indirect smoke is also very bad so we – we should protect nonsmoking people.
I strictly agreed about that.  I think whole restaurant has no smoking mark and also has more strictly control about that.  I mean these days we have also have a punishment about smoking in restaurants but – but some people doesn't think it is important.  I – umm – I like to – to them who thought that is not important.
I disagree smoking.  Smoking is very bad.  Smoking effect nonsmoking people.  Smoking people think smoking – smoking is very bad, but smoking is more bad as smoking people.  Smoking is very – smoking is very bad for get [***] wanted – wanted [***] smoking...
I agree because restaurant is a place where many people eat food together.  If someone smokes the others have to have passive smoking which they don't want and they – many kind of people come to the restaurant.  There's babies, children, youngster, and older people.  I think prohibiting smoking in the restaurant because babies and older people could...
I think that I agreed that – I agreed this opinion.  There are several reasons to support my opinion.  Usually every – every people it is bad for their healthy for my healthy so and second they – if it's they stopped smoking they – they should don't – save the money and they good for – good for their healthy so I think that smoking should – should to banned completely yes this – that is why I agreed with...
I agree this opinions because – because smoker is – nonsmoker are – are sufferings – are suffering smoker because a lot of clash [***] smoker what – what do you think is the many smoker in world because anywhere they smoking is anywhere they will say smoking permission – permission...
Umm – if possible, we must not smoke.  If so, your body will become more healthy.  In addition, we will be more like the people in the surrounding.  People are hate – so the people hate smoking smell, I think.  So we must not smoke right now.  Thank you.

Smoking also very makes people not healthy, and so cigarette costs raise years and years.  This is bad news.  So – and economically, I hope they can smoke for their – ahem – health and that's my opinion.  Smoke – smoke – [***] in my conclusion, in my conclusion.

I think that we – we should have to guarantee – guarantee the smoking section.  Hmm – for example, non-smoking restaurant is not guarantee for the smoking people.  I think smoking is not – not good for our health because smoking is good for our – our comfortable mind or – uhh – and so on.  I think we need more...

Many country try to cut back on smokers because smoking is very bad attitude to all of the person.  Smokers in Korea, President Park radio announced raising cigarette price because she want – uhh – people of the nation improving their health – health – health and want to growing tax.

Smoking effect – um – health.  People's health who is smoking, but the worst another people who nearby smoking person, so I don't like smoking.

Smoking is not bad to body.  Umm – for example – uhh – uhh – especially one – when one smoke – smoke cigarette, she have disease.  Uhh – [***] disease [***] a bad boy.  Oh – so smoking cigarette is not bad [***] this is bad.

I disagree because the restaurant is eating place, so many people is – has qualified [***] happy dinner, so smoking is disturb their happy dinner, so in the restaurant – smoking in the restaurant is...

At first I agree about this topic because at restaurant it means all – all people want to [***] the reason that or people came to restaurant is they want to eat something.  But smoking is really harmful thing for us, especially – so, I – and also restaurant, many children – many children also can come there, so I think it is very harmful thing.  And – oh, yeah, so I just I want to say, I agree about this topic, I agree with this topic, especially at restaurant.

I don't – I don't agree with that opinion.  First of all, in the restaurant, there is not only smoker, but also – there is not only non-smoker but also smoker.  Smoking is worst – smoking is worst – worst like – likely.  And if – if – if smoking is banned then he or she can't smoke – smoking, so he or she feel comfortable, so I think restaurant should make smoking with.  And smoker should smoke...

In restaurant smoking is not good because other people maybe non-smoker or doesn't like smoking, so we [***] it smoking in restaurant.  And smoking is – smoking people [***] having cancer and other people don't like smoking, especially...

There are – there are many people in restaurant.  If they smoke – smoke – smoke – smoke tobacco, uhh – um – um – they [***] umm [***] if teenager see, start smoking by – by adult.  I think that is not good.  Uhh – if the people smoke the tobacco, they...

There is many people that smoke cigarette on work.  On [***] people – people – people [***] drink [***] the smoking – smoking is very important to regulate the smoking law.  And I think civil servant try to regulate the smoking people.  If friend...

Okay.  As I told you before, smoking makes the disease and sometimes non-smoker wants clean smell, like clean air, and they have the right to not to – not to smell smoky – smoking smell.  And we can – we can make smoking area, so everyone, every people can be happy for smokers, smoker are also happy.  Even though – even though the smokers have something, some right to smoke everywhere.  But as I told you that, non-smoker's right should be – uhh...

So in restaurant you should not smoke because people eating, that people eating, people eating their meal, if you smoke along they then they will get very upset because the smoke smells really bad.  But I know some place there is smoking area, so you can go there and you can smoke.  But if you don't have any smoking area, if you can find any smoking area, you should not smoke in restaurant.  If you smoke, you will make worse [***] – you will other people very...

Smoking is restaurant is – smoking in restaurant is very, very not good because restaurant is – many people eat their foods and talk about their affairs [***].  By the way, smoking smell is break their time and talking.  Smoking is...

I think it is not good to prevent smoking in – at the restaurant.  The reason is that the smo – smoking customers provide [***] this important [***] customers wide because they are same customers and they – uhh...

I think – uhh – I think telling the smokers to – uh – not to smoke, I think the venue, smoking place is not very good idea because smokers can choose their place to smoke, so because they have responsibility of choosing – of their choosing, they can choose in the – in proper area, and they can be careful to choose their – choose their – uhh – place.  So, it is not very often or [***] their choice.

Uh, I agree with smoking because it is the will of the individual and personal choice.  Recently, many non-smoking and smoking bus have been specified, so the smoking – the smoke gradually disappear from the street.  People also consider smoking as a negative, so a lot of people also trying to quit smoking.  Now, the smoking is not right or wrong, smoking should be considered with the selection of a person.  Smokers will also be released gradually and healthy society will occur automatically.  Therefore, I agree about the smoking.

Everybody said, the important thing is do not harm the non-smoking people.  The cigarette's impact is very harm, and the direct smoking is harm and also indirect – indirect smoking is harm – harming – harmful.  So, as I said, the non-smoking people have – should permit smoking people smoking – uh – in a way to not harm to them because it is a favor support [***].  And non-smoking people should not – should not.

Umm – smoker is – umm – smoker is good by oneself, but non-smoker don't want – smoker don't want – umm – basically – umm – umm – some a lot smell won't taste smoke –uh –uh – don't...

As I said earlier, I don't speak – I don't – I don't – I don't smoke [***] my opinion.  I disagree with the statement because some people support non smoking formulas toward [***] other public places while other thing – [***] personal like.  Second, people have the right to clean air, but people also have the right to smoke.  Restaurant and other public places should accommodate the like – the non-smoking would be the same as banning smokers, which is basically discrimination that is the reason I disagree with the statement.

I think I totally agree this statement because smoking in restaurant is very, very bad act.  It – it is not good for every people.  They – there are some people who smokes, some people who don't smoke, they are all different people in restaurant.  But – umm – if they – if they – if they are agree, if they want smoke – want smoking people in there and not everybody except him don't smoke.  Smoking people is very bad and he or she doesn't have to should not smoke because it is very – when people eat something...

I agree with the opinion, I disagree to smoking in public.  I can miss [***] that smoker's opinion.  Maybe they want to enjoy it anywhere they are.  But they have to stop smoking in public for everyone.  I think smoking in public is good because it causes bad effect on other people's health.  In my case, when I pass by smokers, I feel stuffy and I can't breathe well.  I think if people has right for their health.  Smokers in public are ignoring our rights, so I don't agree to smoking in public.  Smokers have to enjoy smoking only on their private place.  As a result...

I agree that smoke ban all places for several reasons.  First, smoke has caused – co – smoke caused a lot environmental destruction and smoke create a lot of bad – bad air.  This has led to health problems and global warming.  For this reason I think that smoke ban all place...
I agree with the rest – restaurant ban the smoke because when you smoke in restaurant can hold harmness to people who don't smoke but I disagree with the country banned smoke because tobacco is [***] and smoke – smoke can – smoke can release some stress and make – make – make happy...
Smoking is – passive smoking is really bad – really bad for people, women [***].  It's – it's more worse than the smoker – smoker's health so – so who is passive smoke – so is passive smoking is a big health hazard.  It's really bad.  Smoking is completely banned in the country.  It's...
And ban the smoking in the non – smoke – in the restaurant is important because restaurant is many people they are eating some food and so – umm – country have to ban the smoke – people's smoke in the restaurant so the restaurant people will have to happy time to their eating food time and the smoking is not good for their food because the smoke will be [***] the food and the food is not good for their health so the health point is also checking point in this time and...
Uhh – and I am back and my opinion is conti – my opinion is con – con – same – my opinion is same and smoking is bad – smoking is bad so we have to – we have to ban – we have to ban smoking – smoking for our health and healthy life for – for – for our healthy life it can therefore we can – we can live a more healthy.  Thank you.
What I think about the – the statement on – the smoking – smoking in public place that's just be banned I guess I totally agree with the idea because first of all I am nonsmoker myself, so I don't think it's preferable and in the situation if I [***] about it happening in the public for ladies [***] so it could lead on to the second hand smoking effects which is very hazardous and very harmful to other people other than the smokers themselves so that's two main reasons for me to just agree with the idea of banning smoking in public places.
I think smoking is very unhealthy but you know many people – many people smoke and smoke this day but I really, really hate – hate the people smoke on the – on the road next to me.  I – I really – I really hate that.  I don't want to – I don't want to my friends – my friends and my family – friends and my family smoke.
That was my point and there are many people who actually express their stress by smoking and well smoking is bad for their health but there are many reasons they smoke rather than do other things to serve their stress problem so smoking can be helpful to those smokers' mental health and that's really important thing.  If they do not smoke they might actually drink some alcohol instead of smoke -- 
Now smoking in restaurant is not appropriate because smoking people need to – need a place for smoking and their right for freedom is important so real outdoor [***] smoking is not for – for their health they need to some kind of stress reduce – reducing so they smoke so in restaurants it should be – it can be with smoking place so many people then can some understand people who smoke.  Smoking is important for smoking people so their freedom for...
Uhh – preventing the smoking in all area is ignore the smoking people.  Every people have their own – their own favorite or smoking is one of them.  So, smoking people must have the right to smoking in some area not all area just to – so government give the area the smoking people for their – for their rights – rights.
Smoking is very bad for me and my family so I – so I disagree – so I disagree – so I disagree smoking.  Smoking is for – bad for – smoking is bad for my – for my health.  If – if smoke – if – because smoking – because smoking – because smoking...
I agree that smoking is very bad.  I hate smoking because it smells disgusting and it's harmful to smoker and people who non [***] smoked.  We always hear how smoking is bad so I don't know how explain the smoking's disadvantage.  First, there is a lot of bad thing in cigarette and that make our body get cancer.  Second, it smells disgusting.  I always stop my breath when I met smokers.  Finally, cigarette smoke has a more bad influence on smoker's family or friends or other people who is with smoker so I think smoking is very bad thing.  Thank you.
I agree with that because nonsmoking people have rights.  They have a right to be – to not do to – not to smoke – not to smell the smoking – smoking smell and our nation is – our nation – our nation is democracy so I think – I think it's very – it's very import – important about nonsmoking people's rights but yeah it's also right smoking people have a right too but...
I think smoke and smoking is very bad first – for us – for us you know I think government is selling drugs because they need extra money.  It is – I think it's not that much positive system.  Second, it is not good for – not good for health not for smokers themselves but also people nearby for – and just for public health.  Second is I heard that second – second hand smoking is just bad – just as bad as just smoking – smoking and smoking directly and for – for babies – babies, handicapped people, and old people are surrounded with dangers of...
I agree about the argument.  Already I have said I really hate smoking smell.  Maybe some people think my answer is selfish, but I hate smoking smell.  Second, as you know smoking is bad for health and indirect smoke is worse [***] so in these two I mean we should protect nonsmoking people and we need to prevent the situation that the smoker people properly so I think smoke -- 
Yeah once again I – I love to there – they – they have – they have got changed.  I am – I – I really hate smoking but second smoking is not only me – the whole people think the second hand smoking is very bad for health and that is why smoking is strictly forbidden in whole restaurant.  Maybe government should be changed more...
I disagree smoking in restaurant.  Smoking is very bad.  Smoking of the nonsmoking people.  People come to restaurant for eat and children come restaurant for eat.  Smoking is very bad to children.  Smoking people think smoking so bad not – smoking is – what – why smoking is bad.  They always think – think...
I agree because restaurant is a place where many people eat food together.  If someone smoke the others have to have passive smoking which they don't want and many kind of people come to the restaurant.  There is babies, children, youngster, and older people.  I think prohibiting smoking in the restaurant because babies and older people could get harm due to smoking.  Thank you.
Uhh – I think that I agree the smoking have to do banned and have to ban completely.  First, it is – it is good for our healthy.  Second, our streets were clean I think.  And, in my case my father is smoking in that I sometimes I am very angry that – that – that angry – angry [***] because my – I – I don't like the smell and something of – sometimes my father is – is not cleaning my room so I think that smoking have to ban.
The smoke causes cancer.  Nonsmoker can get cancer by the smoke – smoke – smoke – smoker – smoke they breathe in.  Nonsmokers can also the smoke caused environmental problem and it brings breathing problem and [***] so I agree to smoking completely banned anyplace.  Nonsmoker is smoke – nonsmoker can get cancer by the smoke they breathe in.
