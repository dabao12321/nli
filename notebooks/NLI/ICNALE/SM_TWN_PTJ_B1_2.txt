Yeah, about this question that if it is important for college students to have a part-time job, I think it depends on different individuals.  But I think people should not take a part-time job while they are in college because I think in this – in this period of time, at college, we students should improve our knowledge and our own skills for our future rather than taking a part-time job because part-time jobs takes a lot of time, and you have to work every day for – for 8 hours or something, and you – you can only earn a little money.
Well, I agree that it is important for students to get a part-time job in the college, so I am hold the opinion that getting a part-time job for your student is totally wasting your life.

I think students will play most of time.  Now that we are now studying which is originally duty for student, I don't really do more meaningful things such as doing part-time job, so – so I think it is appropriate for college students to – to get the part-time job, so that's – that's my opinion of this topic, yeah.

Yeah, the first point that I think take a part-time job is a waste of time, and second, others says that some students may have to be – have to search for job for – for his own expense for studying because their – their family cannot support, not that much money.

Actually, I have had an experience working in McDonald's when I just graduated from high school for 2 months, and I think it helped me a lot – it really helped me a lot, you know.  I always thought that I could do good – I could – I could do a good job in – in the service – service industry given that I was nearly a clerk.  I had a lot of fantasy toward it, however, as I really studied to get through the job, I realized that all I want is Saturday, Monday, and I couldn't stand the – the unsure holidays, so it is what I learned from my part-time job.

I quite agree because in school we have learnt a lot about the knowledge, about speaking, writing, and we have already majoring the favorite subject, and for me, such as business administration.  However, we still need some skills outside school such as communicating with others, and in the outside – in the world outside the school, we can acquire a lot of opportunities which can help us grow.  Again, we must become more independent, and which is very important, so we cannot limited our time and our life only in school.

I think it's not very important for college students to have a part-time job in college because I think that when you get to a college, you – the first thing you have to do is to study, and the second thing you have to do is join a club and making friends.  You can grow your sight and learn many things then, so I think it's important, it's not very important for college students to have a part-time job in college.
I think not all the college students' family are very rich, so if some of the students are not so rich, so they might have to have a part-time job to earn for their – their – their money to study, so it is quite important for college students to have a part-time job.  They will make more money and will grow up more faster than they stay in school.  That is my point.

Well, I think it's important for college students to have part-time jobs if they [***] in new jobs because they can learn something new which they cannot learn from school and their family like time management and the new relationship with – with people and their partners.  Especially in eastern culture we think student just need to study harder and harder but just like learn something from school or from their books, the theory, but I think they meet more people and then learn relationship is more important than school studies.


I think students should concentrate on their studies and they should – they should only taking part-time jobs in summer or winter vacation.

They also – they also – they are – they don't go to school and this is very different, very – very not good I think, because you need to focus on your main – main jobs.  If you are a student, your main job is to study.  Money is - if money is very important for you, then you can have a scholarship or – or go to – go to some school work.


I think – I think the present is up to everybody what they might choose, but not for me - mentioned if - I don't want to have the part-time job so far because I have the major independence and friends, that I think I can pay attention in my class more.

If I went to the junior or senior, I think maybe I will choose the part-time job too, to do and I hope that I can have more experience about the university because university is the most important level in our life.  You – you cannot have the second life - I think we can have the part-time job in the university if we don't have the experience before.  It's more – it's more important than anything, when you just want to play and don't have to go to – go to - experience your life with other things.
