Smoking should not be completely banned in all restaurants and the country because nowadays smokers are very common and if smoking is completely banned, then they have nowhere to go to smoke.  They would have to hide themselves in order to avoid being illegally punished, avoid being punished, so they will – so will go to the toilet or small corner to smoke and that would cause more harm to people because polluted gas like carbon dioxide emitted from the cigarette will – would be concentrated in one space.  So, if all the people go – go to that area, they will smoke all the carbon dioxide...

I – I agree with this statement.  I think restaurants are the places that people go to eat and they should enjoy their right – the nonsmokers, they should enjoy their right to be able to eat without any disturbance by the smoke.  Smoking, as we all know, is harmful, is bad for our health.  In places like – in a place like restaurants, I think it is important to keep the environment clean but with the smoking, I don't think it is helpful for – for people around the smokers.  So, it should be banned in restaurants.  Although I think smokers also enjoy their own right to smoke but not in a restaurant, maybe in other places without disturbing other...

I agree that smoking should be banned because of the three reasons.  First, it is because smoking is not good for our health, especially our lungs and [***] disease [***] the risk of [***] health problems.  Second, I think for passive smoker, it is the environment and the people around them are also affected because the secondhand smoke will also – also affect others health and have a serious impact on them.  So, I think smoking may increase...

Yeah, I think smoking should be banned because, well first of all, it is bad for our health.  There are like many medical reports that that say like if you smoke, then you would have a higher chance of getting lung cancer and not just you, you know people around you who – who have to handle the secondhand smoke would also have a greater chance of suffering from lung cancer and you know health is such an important part of our life.  So, that is definitely one of the reasons why smoking should be banned.  And I think the second reason would be like there are people who – who are not – who are nonsmoker but when – when they are in the street, when they are like waiting to cross the road or just lining up for – for bus, there will always be a smoker there and then they would just smoke and...

I agree that smoking should be totally banned because of various reasons.  First of all, smoking is bad for health that inside a cigarette, it has different chemicals that will lead to various disease like cancers and very severe diseases – so – like it contains nicotine and different kinds of chemicals.  So, it is bad for health and for people who doesn't smoke, we suffered from the secondhand smoke problem that we are forced to inhale those toxic chemicals that we don't want to.  So, it leads to bad health for those who don't smoke.  Also, it worsens air quality because the chemicals from the smoke will...

I think smoking should not be completely banned because I think [***] smokers to choose whether they want to smoke or not because - yes, smoking harms themselves, the health, but [***] given the freedom – so long if they can have enough money to buy the cigarette, I think they should be allowed to smoke.  People will say that, you know, they are often creating problems for the people around them, but [***] other kind of policy like policy of [***] smoking [***] or even you know increasing the price of cigarettes, so that they...

I agree with the statement.  I think that smoking should be completely banned in the country because nowadays not only there are smoking problems, but secondhand smoking problem is also very serious.  When you are walking on the street, although there are some places actually ban if you smoke.  There are still some people that smoke there and so the secondhand smoking problem is very serious.  I think in order to stop their situation, they are completely banning of smoking is needed.  Secondly, the completely banning smoking actually can – umm – can to promote health and also can reduce the numbers of people who died of smoking because the number of people of who died of smoking is still increasing every year.  So, I think this policy is needed.

I agree that smoking should be completely banned all over the country and there are two reasons why I agree with this claim [***].  Firstly, it is – everyone knows that smoking – smoking is bad for our health.  People who smoke may die earlier or they may suffer from lung cancer when they get older.  So there is a [***] such illnesses in future, actually it may – it does not only affect their health, but it will also increase the financial burden on the family.  So, on one hand if the government decides to ban smoking all over the country, for sure it can improve the health of their citizens and on the other I think it can lessen or at least alleviate...

Well I think that smoking should be banned completely because of smoking is very annoying to the nonsmokers.  We know that the secondhand smoke is more disastrous than the firsthand smoke.  When a smoker smoke, there should be secondhand smoking.  So, therefore, it will harm not only the – the people but maybe the younger people and that's very annoying, very disastrous, so we have to ban all smoking in the public area.  This is not depriving the right for the smoker to smoke, but they have the choice, they have the right to smoke but we have the right to stay away from smoking and therefore if they smoke in the private area, we will not be affected but if they smoke in the public area, we will be much affected.  So, therefore, the smoking should be banned in all public area.  So, this is my point and I strongly – umm – support this claim.  So because...

I agree that smoking should be completely banned in the country because we all know that smoking is bad to our health.  If we smoke, we will have a higher chance of getting cancer.  Also, to – the secondhand smoke will also poses harm to other people even though they do not smoke.  Also, if – although we say that smoking is our own choice, that we shouldn't being forced not to smoke, we – we should also consider the others because if we smoke then that the others around you cannot choose not to breathe in the smoke that you exhaust.  So, I think it's not good to have smoking...

Personally, I don't really like people smoking especially in front of me or in front of a lot of children or other people.  But then I think smoking should not be banned in all places because people still have their freedom to choose whether to smoke or not.  So, instead of like ban smoking in the whole city in Hong Kong or in the country, I'd rather to have smoking banned in certain places.  For example, like park or indoor – indoor places so – or near school, at least smoking wouldn't affect so many people, especially like children or old people or other – yeah, other parties as well.  So, I think smoking should not be banned like in all the city, but rather should be restricted to certain areas.

I do agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants [***] it is like in my society, in the community around me, it's like when I went to restaurant, as I always smell the terrible smell of the smokes.  As I – it's really disturbing me to have a meal.  It's like – it is not healthy to inhale the secondhand smoke as well and it is because of the smell, it's the terrible smell and I think it is really disturbing the other people in the community and the diners in the restaurants.  Also, it is about the health problem.  Because the secondhand smoke is really detrimental to the health of other people.  They are in...

I do not agree that smoking should be banned in all countries, in all nations because first I think that the most important thing is that everyone has their – has his or her own freedom to choose whatever they want.  I think that smoking is just like a hobby that – it is just like going to park, just like going to – going for a run.  So that – so, I don't think we should ban people from smoking.  And I know that some people may argue that smoking is harmful to health, I think it's quite similar to alcohol.  Alcohol is harmful to health when it is taken in large amount.  I think it just depends on how people use it and who can't control well [***] or not and I think that smoking is not that harmful...

I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and all over the country because we are not saying that we have to ban in all places over the countries, just limited, exceptional for restaurants and – in every restaurant I think – umm – the customers or the people should – will actually like to enjoy their meals in a more comfortable area, with smoke - smoking-free area, to enjoy really the taste, with the smell of the food, instead of smoking.  Yeah, smoking smell.  So, I think it is to be fair or is to be – to fair to all the nonsmoking customers – umm – and to be considerate that they should not smoke, for smokers do not smoke in the restaurants that they should be...

These days some people say that – uh – smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country and I do not agree with this statement.  First of all, of course – uh – for the cigarette it is the main – uh – it is a part of the tax income of the government where the government can make quite a large amount of tax income from having the cigarette in citizens, so if smoking – so – is completely banned and they – uh – the government get – uh – uh – – will get the less income. Apart from that – um – although smoking is one of the source of the poor air quality in the countries that it is – and it also – uh – damaged peoples' health and in turn the government can – cannot deprive peoples' right from – uh – smoking or having this fixed – uh –  it is their own choice and...

Yes I think – I think that smoking should be banned completely in the whole country because I think smoking is that behavior and it will pose threat to people's health and it will – because of the dangers of being that, it will also add burden to government services, especially the hospital service.  So, I think if we ban smoking in the whole country, the burden of the government will be less and the government can use this money to....

I disagree with this topic because I think it is very difficult to implement – umm – this scheme.  As – firstly, citizens should enjoy their freedom on doing different things as long as it is not harmful to any other citizens and smoking shouldn't be really an illegal action should be banned completely by law but I think it is important to consider the harmful effects of smoking and therefore people can choose to like and the smoking in indoor area and restaurants or any places with many pregnant women or children, so as to lower the effects on them.  And it is important for government to educate the smokers to really...

I strongly agree with this notion.  First of all, I think smoking is a very selfish act because smoking is optional whereas breathing is not and smoking can lead to many health problems like heart attack or lung problems.  So, banning smoking can help reduce the risk of second hand smoke, it can also reduce – reduce the – the production of some hazardous particles from the cigarettes.  So, it can...

These days some people say that smoking should be banned at the restaurants in the country.  I agree with it.  Imagine that you are eating in a very beautiful and high class restaurant with a beautiful scenery and a man sitting next to you is smoking when you are enjoying the very mouthwatering food in front of you, you can still smell the odor of the cigarette.  It will totally spoil your appetite and also spoil your mood even if you are eating in a very beautiful environment, and it would  --  would be a very bad disturbance to you as you -- 
Some people say that smoke should be banned in all restaurants in the country.  I support this statement, because I think – uh – banning smoke can – um – brings lot of positive effects to both smokers and nonsmokers.  Um. For smokers – um – it is well known that smoking is bad for their health because – uh – the materials that – um – the substances in the smoke – in the cigarette will bring harmful effects, for example the – um – nicotine and – will cause them have the – uh – lung cancers, so – uh – ban – uh – so restricting their – uh – places for them to smoke may help them, and for nonsmoker – if we – uh – do not smoking – if we do not smoke, and smoke – smoking is banned in the restaurant we will have a more clean – a cleaner place and a place with fresher air to eat.  So – um – for both smokers and nonsmokers this is good for them...

Uh.  I support banning smoking in restaurants and other open areas.  For some smokers are smoking in restaurants is their right and also their freedom to smoke, but I think there are just a minority of people who think – who have that thinking.  Uh.  For the most of the people – uh – smoking is not good for the health and – uh – it can – uh – damage the lungs or respa – respiratory tracts for example, so – um – for smokers they can still smoke in their homes or in their – um – – yeah in their homes, so – um – it is not good for the smokers to smoke in open areas with – which are – is like a common area for all the citizens.  Um...
I agree that smoking should be banned completely at all places in the city.  As first and foremost is the health concern.  Smoking is absolutely harmful to people who smoke as the cigarette and the substances like nicotine or the carbon dioxide may cause health problem to one who smoke, like lung cancer, that is obvious and very obvious, and – um – besides second-hand smoking that means that when someone smoke and then he – the air that she or he breathe out can be even more harmful to people around, that means that if I smoke – if I get in the smoke I will be in – I would also got a chance to have lung cancer or have...
Uh.  I don't think smoke is – smoking should be banned in – in everywhere, because – um – personally I don't like the smell of smoke and I know that smoking is bad for – um – our health, but still I think it is a way for some smokers to send their – um – emotions because living in or working will cause them the blood pressure so – um –a way should be given to them – uh – for them to re – relieve their pressure and it is not a big deal in my opinion, so I don't think smoking should be banned.
I disagree because smoking should only be partially banned or – in the country.  If it is completely banned, then smokers have nowhere to smoke, not to mention that smokers number – number of smokers is very large these days.  So, if they have nowhere to smoke, they have to in order to obey the law, they have to go to the corners or washrooms to smoke.  Then that will cause more harm to people who use those facilities and those places.  So, once my professor, my chemistry professor used – used the carbon dioxide emitter to measure the carbon dioxide level of a corner where people have just smoked.  It's very, very bad, but when he measured it in the restaurant where there is lots of carbon dioxide...

I definitely agree with this statement.  The restaurants are the places that people go to eat.  I think it is important to keep the restaurants clean and hygienic with smoke or around the places, I don't think that it is healthy.  I don't think it's clean or comfortable for people to dine, to eat there.  So, I think smoking should be banned.  Although I don't think smokers can't smoke, of course but – I think for nonsmokers does not wish to smell the smoke when they eat.  So, maybe – umm – banning smoking in restaurants can enhance – can –can keep the environment cleaner and more comfortable for people to eat their food.

I agree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants for three reasons.  First, it is not good for the health of us, like lungs and also keeping smoking increases the risk of getting serious disease and problems in different organs like our lungs and they also [***] cancer.  Second, I think secondhand smoke is also a big problem for others like people around the smoker that they – people around the smoker are pregnant or child, it is not good for them.  Third, I think in the restaurant you are not expecting – you do not expect having air polluted or polluted air in the restaurant.  We want – we just want to enjoy our meals, so I think smoking should be banned at the restaurant.

Yeah, I think smoking should be banned because first of all it's bad for your health.  If you smoke, you have a greater chance of suffering from lung cancer and it's not just you, people around you who have to handle all the secondhand smoke will only suffer.  I mean if you smoke, your family suffers.  If you are pregnant, the baby inside you would suffer and you don't want to do things to those innocent people.  And I also think that it should be banned because just for the better environment or for whatever reasons, like when you wait for the bus or you wait to cross the road, there always be someone smoking and then they will blow the smoke like literally in your face and that's the worst thing to do, especially to someone with asthma or someone with...

I agree that smoking should be totally banned because of various reasons.  First of all, it's bad for health obviously because inside a cigarette, it contains lots of toxic chemicals which may lead to various disease like cancers, different kinds of cancers and for those who don't smoke – umm – it leads to another problem, the problem is secondhand smoke.  For those who don't want to – who doesn't like smoking, the secondhand smoke also worsens the health.  For another reason that why smoking should be banned because it worsens the air quality, it pollutes the environment.  Also, for a better city image, I think smoking should be totally banned because like citizens or tourists won't like – don't like to see a city with lots of smokers and smoke everywhere...

I think smoking should not be completely banned in the restaurants.  I think although restaurant is a rather small area, but I think this people should be allowed to smoke because this is the freedom and even though it may harm others [***] smoking area.  For example, when you are [***] like [***] you don't feel like [***] and then they smoke there and you are smoking [***] living in the same [***].  I think the same should be applied for restaurants and I think if you want...

I agree with the statement.  I think it is needed to completely ban smoking in the country.  Firstly, not only the smoking problem, the secondhand smoking problem is also serious nowadays.  When you are walking on the street, although there are some places where a ban that you smoke, there are still some people smoke and it affects other people and the secondhand smoking problem is that serious and [***] affect those people I think it's very unfair.  Also, the number of people who died of smoking is still increasing this year.  Actually, smoking is already a very bad behavior and also is – also easily affect other people.  So I think it's needed to completely ban this, ban smoking and make the country...

I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because restaurant is a sort of a public space.  It's not only smokers can enter the restaurants.  People who do not smoke can also enter the restaurants.  So, people who do not smoke or who hate smoking, if other people entering the restaurants are smokers, if they smoke, when they eat at the same time, it will badly affect the environment of the restaurant.  So, if smoking can be banned in restaurants, it will be beneficial for nonsmokers and because secondhand smoke produces smokers [***] effect of [***] nonsmokers.  So, smoking can be banned in restaurants, it will not...

Well, in my opinion smoking should be banned in all public area because of one thing.  It is very selfish for the smoker to have the secondhand smoke affected to nonsmoker.  We know that yes, they have the right to do so.  They have the right to smoke but we also have the right, all nonsmokers have the right to stay away from the smoke.  So, therefore, if they smoke in a public area, it is unavoidable that the secondhand smoke will affect us, we will breathe in it and therefore harm our body.  So, if they smoke in the private area, they have no one nearby.  They can enjoy their smoke.  They can enjoy their hobby and they can enjoy themselves without affecting other people.  Just think about the others.  If we want to enjoy our right, but we should not do it at expense of other people's right also.  So, in a public area, it is unavoidable...

I agree that smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants and the country because in the restaurants that the window are mostly closed and if someone smokes inside the restaurant, then the other diners cannot choose not to breathe in the bad air that you have exhaled and that smoking is bad for our health as we all know that.  It can cause a higher chance of having cancers and other disease and although smoking is our own choice, we shouldn't – umm – do not consider others feelings and the nonsmokers don't want to have the smoke the around the environment, so smoking should be completely...

I have just mentioned that smoking should not be like banned in all places, in all restaurants because like people do have their choice, but then as long as they do not affect the – the vulnerable others, then they are free to smoke.  So, because if smoking is banned – I know smoking is not a good habit and if the government ban it and it could like deter people from smoking, but then it is still people's freedom to smoke, so I don't think that we should like ban it in all places but rather it should be like restricted to like certain places just like in those areas smokers can smoke, but not in other places, like the indoor places.

In the community around me, when I go to dine in restaurants I always smell the terrible smell of someone smoking and I find it really disturbing and I hate that so much.  First of all, it is because of the very disturbing smell.  It will affect your mood when you are having a wonderful meal and then you can't really taste the delicious food instead you just smell the smell of smoking and I just think that it's really disturbing to other diners.  Also, the secondhand smoke is really detrimental to health and when somebody is smoking and you would inhale the secondhand smoke and it will have terrible effects to your lungs and that's why I think it should...

I do not agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants because everyone has their own [***] to smoke.  It's just like a hobby, like someone else going to swimming or going to walk.  As long as they didn't affect – they don't affect other people, it's okay.  I think maybe the restaurants can divide an area for smoking area, so that it won't affect other customers and I think that smoking is just like drinking alcohol. So some people may say, it's harmful for health, but as long as people don't abuse it, I think it's acceptable.  We should respect others.  We should respect others' hobby and interests.  And I think smoking is not as harmful as drugs.  So, it's not reasonable for us to ban smoking in all restaurants.

I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned all over the restaurants in the country.  Firstly, restaurant is really a confined place, especially the indoor ones.  Umm – we have to be fair to the nonsmokers and all the people who are – people and customers in the restaurants because actually all people would like to have a comfortable and smoking free area for their dining place.  They would like to really enjoy or really taste, smell the real smell, and the taste – of the food; and we are not banning all over the places just exceptional for restaurants.  So, it is – I think it is fair treatment or fair policy that smokers – or smoking should be banned in all the restaurants over the country.  Yeah.

These days some people say that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in country, and I disapprove with this statement.  First of all, cigarette is a part of the tax income of the government; if smoking is completely banned people may somehow see – uh – may still smoke secretly and they will try to buy the cigarette from the black market, and therefore the government may – uh – gain a less – uh – tax income and also there will be – uh – other crimes rising. Apart from that also smoking is one of the source of the poor air quality – to the air pollution and it may also cause damage to our health, but there is no right for the government to deprive people from – uh – smoking.  It is the right of the public to choose their own habits and no one can stop them from this one right, and for smoking cannot be completely banned at all public...

I think it is important to – it is necessary to ban smoking compulsory in the whole country because smoking is a bad behavior that can pose a threat to people's health.  So I think – uhh – if we ban smoking in whole country, it can help – uhh – the citizens to have more – better health and also help to – uhh – the government to ease the burden of the need to allocate more resources in the medical services and I think as zero people will be – will be dead [***] because of smoking, their [***] who are also workforce [***]...

I disagree with this topic because I think banning smoking in the whole restaurants is very difficult to implement.  As this – the people, the customers should have their freedom to enjoy smoking.  However, I think it is more effective for the restaurant to separate areas for smokers and nonsmokers and therefore this policy can help different people to enjoy their time in the restaurants and secondly, it is more important for some type of restaurants to ban smoking like those restaurant with many pregnant women or many children inside and this can minimize the effects of smoking towards those specific groups.  Lastly, I think for the restaurants, it needs to really implement – uhh – this...

I strongly agree with this notion because I think smoking is a selfish act.  It is mainly because I think smoking is optional whereas breathing is not.  When you smoke you produce a lot of hazardous particles to the air and that will affect people around you.  So, banning smoking can help reduce the effects and produ – protect people from the effect of secondhand smoke – uhh – like heart disease or lung cancer or even other diseases.  So, it is important to implement this kind of ban, so that people's health can be protected and I also think that banning smoking can help...

These days some people say that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country, and I totally agree with it.  Imagine that you are eating in a very high class restaurant with a beautiful spectacular scenery; while you are enjoying the mouth-watering food in front of you, you can still smell the odor of the cigarette from the man sitting next to you; if  --  it would be a total disturbance to you and it will spoil your appetite and also your mood, even if you are eating in a very beautiful environment.  Also, smoking is harmful to -- 
Some people say that smoke should – should be banned in all restaurant in the country.  I personally support this statement, because I think it is adventurous to – uh – it brings positive effects to both smokers and non-smokers.  For smokers because smoking is bad for their health – health, so – um – um – restricting their places for them to smoke – uh – really can improve their health.  Um. A lot of cancers, for example lung cancers and – uh – nasal cancers may – uh – is – uh – caused by smoking, so banning the smoke is good for them.  For nonsmokers – uh – if you are eating in the restaurant you would like to have a fresher air and with – uh – no smoke in the restaurant, so then – uh – restricting the smoking in the restaurant is good, and – uh – moreover because the second-hand smoke – uh – will also harm the nonsmoker health, so we should create an environment for them to have a – uh – air clean...

Uh, I totally do support – uh – banning smoking in restaurants and other open areas.  For some smokers – uh – they definitely disagree this idea, because they think it is their right to smoke in restaurants and open areas; it is their freedom, so if we ban them from smoking in these places we suppress their freedom, but I totally disagree because smokers are only are – account for a minority of the people, and for most of us the mig – the majority – um – smoking definitely has more disadvantage to our health, and also smokers can still smoke in their homes, so – uh – they do not need to smoke in restaurants, and also I think banning smoking can help the smokers to get rid of...
I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants as – um – first and foremost there is health concern that those who smoke – um – may cause – uh – smoking may cause harmful effects to those smoke like – and who get cigarette and the substance inside like nicotine or carbon dioxide may cause lung cancer that is very obvious. Besides it – restaurant – they are all closed areas, so second-hand smoke may also affect the people or the – and diners around you, and second-hand smoker claim it'll be even more harmful to people they – which they – if they breathe in second-hand smoking, and besides the food – um – you eat in restaurants you're supposed to be eating and the smoke gets easily afloat, it will so disgusting and not really – um – hygienic enough, so it's both harmful to your health, and also to the – or the at – atmosphere in a restaurant and...

Um.  I think it is wise for dividing the restaurant into areas for smokers and nonsmokers, because I don't think – um – smoking should be banned – um – in wherever it is because – um – it is a way for people to release their stress and pressure, so this shouldn't – so people shouldn't – um – restrain others' – uh– freedom and their right to smoke – um – as long as – uh – well, as long as they are not affecting others or it doesn't cause any trouble then I think it's fine.  So, yeah I don't think smoking should be banned as long as – um...
