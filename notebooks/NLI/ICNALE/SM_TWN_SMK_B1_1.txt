I – I totally agree this topic, smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in Taiwan.  I think smoking will harm people's health, so all people shouldn't smoking, especially in public, like restaurants.  People who smoke in the restaurant, not just harm to their – their self but harm people who don't smoke.  If people shouldn't smoke in restaurant, we may be more healthy.  No people should be so selfish.  Someone who like to smoke can just smoke in – in his house, not smoke in the public.  Besides, smoking is, well, influence the – the atmosphere and that's not good, so all restaurants should ban...
I strongly agree smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in Taiwan because I hate the people smoking.  The smoke smell is – smell disgusting.  When I was eating my – my food, I don't want anyone to – I don't want anyone smoke near my table – near my table because the smoke is unhealthy to people.  I think anyone shouldn't – shouldn't smoking because it make the cancer.  So I think Taiwan should ban smoking anywhere.  Although, in...
Yes, I agree with this statement because I really don't like – I really don't like smoking.  I think smoking should be completely banned at restaurants or in country public places.  I hate people who smoking in public places because smoking, the smell is bad and not healthy.  So I think the country should – should stop people smoking.  Smoking is – is not good thing for – for everything.  I – I really don't like smoking.  So I hope the restaurant could stop people smoking in public.
Well, let me think about it.  I think I will agree because smoking is totally damage our personal [***] I think.  Now, there are so many people such as business men, sailors, workers, etcetera, who like to smoke when they have a free time.  But in my opinion, even though [***] strong customer have a different ages here to join their restaurant and meals, finish with meals.  If there some customer smoke in their restaurant, and the smoke, the smell cover over the delicious smell in the restaurant air, you can say that it's very painful to...
I agree.  I think smoking should be – not – not smoke in the restaurant because smoke is very bad.  It will make the air smell bad and make people unhealthy, especially in restaurant.  It's – it's a – restaurant is a place for people to eat and drink and not only the adult but also the children.  That's very bad for them.  Smoking is very bad for people, and I think everyone shouldn't do that, protect yourself and your family, also your friends.  If somebody really wants to smoke, I think they should go outside and don't impact any others.  It's very bad.  
Yes, I totally agree.  Smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants in the country.  First, as such, there are a lot of people have cigarette smoke is make us feel uncomfortable.  And second, people are thought it's not fair for not smoking to go – to go through the ordeal of breathing smoke filled air.  So, it is inconsiderate of people to smoke in the same place.  Third, as the smoke – smoke makes air quality bad.  In a restaurant, if I smell smoking, it is so disgusting and don't want to eat food in a restaurant and don't want to come in to the same restaurant again.  So, they should put the cigarettes out now.
In my personal opinion, I do support the idea that smoking should be completely banned in – in restaurant for you know in a – in a non-open, you know, inner space, you now, in the interior so to speak.  Because usually, you know, when – when – when you – when you smell – when you smell the smoke, it is – it is [***] pretty even more harm – harmful for the nonsmoker, you know, sitting besides – sitting next – sitting next to smoker himself.  And also, it – it makes the – the atmosphere pretty, you know, it – it – it would make it, you know, very weird and awkward to sit – to sit in a, you know, at a place where smoking is allowed and...
Yes, I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in the – in – in all countries because the smell of smoking is not – is not good – is not comfortable by everybody.  And this smell is not good.  For me, I think it's bad, and in restaurant, we have to have meal, we have to have delicious meal, but if at this time, somebody bad smell like smoking come, I don't think I – I am very – I can enjoy this meal.  So I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants, and in other talk, in other way to say, the smoking is, the smell of smoking...
Yes, I think smoking should be completely banned because lots of my friends and family, they are smoking but they – they don't even smoke when they are eating because it's – I don't know.  They think it's kind of impolite – impolite because it's just weird, so they don't even smoking while – while they are eating themselves, so how could you smoke after – when other peoples are eating.  I know smoking after eating is – feels good but it's also impolite, so I think it – it should be banned.  Yeah, that's my...
I support that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country.  Everybody know that smoking is not good – is not good for our healthy but also other people smell, the secondhand smoke is also not good for the – in Taiwan, there are more and more people it smells at the restaurant.  We go to the restaurant for the lunch or dinner.  We have – we can have a good mood when we have our meals.  It is not fair for us when we have lunch and we must to smell the secondhand smoke, not only in Taiwan but also in Japan that I hope that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country.
I – I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country because if I saw someone smoking in the public places, I would point the cigarette at someone.  I think when you go to a restaurant, just recharge your battery, just relax, don't think – don't worry your job or love, just pat your hair down and have a really good time, enjoy in your meal.  If you smoke and I think that atmosphere...
Yes, I think that smoke has been completely banned at restaurants in the country.  In my country, smoke completely banned but when I travel to Japan, I usually see people smoking in restaurants.  It is really bad.  It is really not – I didn't feel good for this.  I really hate smoke up – I really hate the smell of the smoke.  I hope rather smoke has been completely banned at restaurants in any country.  The smoke smell makes me feel yuck and make my emotion become worse.  Most important of it is harmful for my health.  So I strongly agree that smoke should be banned at restaurants in the country.
Everyone has knowing smoking will harm to our health.  However, there are still many people keep on smoking among us.  We should start the anti-smoking campaign in every place.  If someone ask you in restaurant, will you mind my smoking here, what you – what did you say?  My father are smoking too.  I hope him will live longer and cut it because my grandfather had died from the cancer.  He was – he was smoking for a long, long time.  My family are angry and said, he does – he didn't try to...
I support to completely banned – banned smoking in the restaurant or public – public.  I don't like the cigarette – cigarette smoke – stink smell.

Yes, I definitely think that it is important thing to ban the smoking in the restaurant.  It is really necessary.  I can affect anyone smoking in the restaurant.  I think that is really dirty thing, and I don't want to smell any smoke in the restaurant when I am eating my dinner or lunch.  I also think that it is a rude behavior.  And it is really impolite.  If you are eating a delicious food in the restaurant, but there is someone smoking beside you, then you have to smell his smoke all the time.  It will very annoy me, and I think it is...
Well, I hate smoker.  I really hate smoker.  Smoke tastes like just disgusting, and I hate people like teachers, students smoking in the university – university.

Yes, I agree because nowadays research report – reports that cigarette contains many things that are harmful to people.  What's more – what's more is if a person is smoking, the people next to him will go on his cigarette too.  That is terrible.  I really hate people who smoke.  Usually, people who smoke are not good, and they affect other people who don't smoke, when they are smoking.  I may say yes if the government want to take more tax on the cigarette when people buy it because buying cigarette is not a positive way to use money.

I totally agree this topic.  I think smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in Taiwan.  Smoking is so bad, and smoking will harm people's health.  All people should not smoke, especially in public, like restaurants.  People who smoke in a restaurants is very selfish because they do not harm their own self, their own health but harm people who don't smoke, and if the restaurant has many children or old men, then it's not – not good.  You shouldn't smoke in – in front of children and old men.  That may influence their health, so people who smoke should just smoke in their house, not smoke in the public, and they should even quit smoking because they – it's very, very bad...
I strongly agree smoking should be completely banned at restaurants in Taiwan because I hate people smoking.  When I was eating my food, I don't want anyone smoking near my table because it smells disgusting, and smoking is unhealthy.  It will make cancer.  So, anybody shouldn't smoking.  I think Taiwan should ban the smoking anywhere; hospital, restaurant, school, anywhere can't smoking – can't smoke.  I hate the people smoke, so I think restaurants shouldn't smoking.  It will make me sick.
Yes, I agree this – with this statement.  I think smoking is not good, and smoking should be completely banned at restaurants.  I really agree because I don't like smoking.  Actually, I hate people who smoke in public places and smoking – the smell is really bad.  And I really don't like smoking, so I think smell is bad and not healthy, so I think the country should stop people who smoking in public places, and not everyone likes smoking.  So I – I don't – I really don't like smoking.  So I – I – I really agree smoking should be completely banned in the restaurants or any – any public places.
Well, I will say that again, I will agree.  I agree for smoking to – to banned at restaurants in the country, yeah, because there are so many people such as business, and sailors, workers, etcetera like to smoke when they have a free time.  In my opinion, smoke would damage all fresh smell and fresh air, right?  In my university, we are now no smoking in the campus everywhere.  One, we have a big activity in [***] university.  We will [***] smoking in campus, notice by the school.  Then, [***] do not come to [***] university tomorrow, and I will ...
I agree that smoking shouldn't in – at restaurant.  It – it makes the air smell bad and make people unhealthy, especially in restaurant.  It's a place for people to eat and drink place and not only the adults but the children.  That's very bad for them.  Smoking is bad for people.  I think everyone shouldn't do that, and everyone should protect yourself and family, friends to not smoking.  I think it's very important thing.
First, there are a lot people who hate cigarette smoke.  It makes us feel uncomfortable and third and second – sorry second, I thought it's not unfair – it's not unfair to go through the ordeal of breathing smoke-filled air.  So it is not inconsiderate of people to smoke in the same space.  Third, smokes make bad air quality.  In a restaurant, if I smell smoking, it's disgusting to have the food and don't want to come to the same restaurant again.  So – so now, we should put their cigarette out now.  It's important to quit smoking.  Smoking also influence our health and cigarette...
Smoking is also – it should be considered a – a pretty – an offensive stuff and – and this is pretty – an offensive stuff, you know, in terms of health and also I would say that smoking is, you know, it should simply be banned, and there, after all, they are those who do smoke and there are those who do not smoke, and those who do not smoke, they of course would not wish to smell – smell cigarette when – whenever or wherever they sit, you know.  And I would say that, and well, it's pretty – it's still pretty, pretty awkward and so – well...
And I think the smell of the smoking is not good for human's body because we – we know that the cancer – lung cancer is caused by lot of smoking.  And I – I think we don't want to go – go to – go to a restaurant, pay many money, and have – have a good meal but smell of bad – bad – bad smell like smoking and finally we – we may have blood cancer.  So I think that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country, not only in Japan but also in – in every – everywhere.  So, yeah, I think – I think...
No, I don't – I – I agree smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because lots of my friends and family do smoking, but they don't – they don't smoking while – while they are eating.  Because they feel it's – it's impolite and it's weird while – while you are smoking – while smoking while eating.  And so I think it should be banned and how – and don't be so busy.  Why – why you want to eating and want – and smoking?  Why should you be so busy?
It is not fair for nonsmoking people to smell the secondhand smoke.  Everybody know that – everybody know that smoking is not good for our healthy.  It is not only not good for the smoking people but also not good for nonsmoking people.  I support that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country.  I hope that we have a good environment and great restaurant for us to have a meal, not only in Taiwan but also in Japan that I hope that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country.
I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in this country.  If I see someone smoking in the public places like restaurants, I would point the cigarette at someone, but I wish they can quit the smoke or – or they can smoke outside – outside the restaurant.  I think it's better for everyone because the smoking can result bad atmosphere.  The – the – the – the air is not fresh, and if you go to a restaurant, just recharge your batteries and just relax, don't worry about everything, just pat your hair down and have a really good time.
This time, I still think that some smoke has been completely banned at restaurants in the country, and I – because I have come to Japan, and I – when I went to a restaurant and someone smoked beside me, the smell is really make me feel uncomfortable.  I think that smoke – if he want to smoke, just go outside and not smoke in the restaurant because you are making – affect everyone in the restaurant.  So I think that it is important to ban – ban – ban smoke in the restaurant.
Everyone has knowing smoking will harm to our health.  However, there are still many people keep on smoking among us.  We should start the anti-smoking campaign in everyplace.  If someone asks you in restaurant, will you mind my smoking here, what will you say.  My father are smoke - – sorry my father is smoking too at home.  He will live longer and cut it because my grandfather was died from cancer.  My family are very angry and sad because he didn't to protect his body and didn't want to quit the smoking, so I really hate smoking people because they didn't...

This is a very – I think this is very dirty, and I don't want to smell any smoke in the restaurant when I am eating.  I think that it's a rude behavior.  If you are eating a delicious food in the restaurant, but there is someone smoking beside you, then you have to smell his smoke all the time.  You are very annoyed me.  So I think it is very important to...
I – naturally, I – I don't agree smoking.  I hate smoking and I hate people smoking in the public place like the university.  Sometimes, I see the teacher and students smoking in the university, and I don't like that, doing smoking.  It has a bad smell – smell, and I think much smoking is unhealthy and tend to hurt the body.  And I don't find the people that smoking is look charming or sweet smell.  People shouldn't smoking in the public place like school, and that's – that's why I really...
Well, just as I said above your question, I agree that we should not smoke in the restaurant because of bad smell, and it will be harm to our health and except our body, we will also harm of the others who smell the smoke, and that's not a good thing for the others.  Well, you might say that's not my business, but I think you should think about the others while you are doing many things.  That's what [***], so I don't think this is the reason that you shouldn't smoke in the restaurant, and you will – and smoking will affect the smell of the food – make the food – make the food does not be...

I don't like people smoking, so I agree.  Smoking is harmful to – to people and it also affect people who don't smoke.  I think smoking should be not permitted anywhere inside the buildings and the government should choose some places for the smoker and set on restriction.  By doing so, I think it can be ensured that the smell of cigarette will not be brought into the section where people that don't smoke are sitting.  By the way, I may say yes if the government want to take more tax on the cigarette because – because spending money on...
