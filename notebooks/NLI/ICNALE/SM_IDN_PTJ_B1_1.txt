Yes, I agree with the student to take part-time job - part-time job when they are studying at university because they can implement their knowledge while they are studying, and it also teaches them to study how to work – how to work and also it's very beneficial because we did something practically like teaching some children in the private office.  As I did - when I started this [***] of my university I teach some children and this was some experience for me, I can implement my knowledge and also get experience for teaching and yeah it's very useful and I agree that part-time job is very important when the students are studying at the university to implement and apply their knowledge in the society.  Before they graduated from the university they have experience...


You know I'll make it clear once again as a student of university we will – we have to work as and - as we can because we are – we are actually - we are going to university fee - we're seeing that we have to be off to be a worker one day and so that university we will be - person then we have to take a part-time job as soon as we can in our university.  Yeah, that's my opinion.  And I think it will be nice if we can work when we are young enough, we can experiment many things.  It may be well with...


I agree with the college – with college student to have part-time jobs because the part-time jobs have – it has many benefits for the college students.  It can be the – the first training for college student to enter their job – job work, job work like that.  And college students can train how to manage her time and her financial.  They can improve their –their skill - English skill and their time – their skill on the time management and the responsibility of the job.  For college student, it's very many benefit...


I agree with that that a part-time job could help student deepen their understanding of the knowledge delivered in university and to be more mature.  At first taking a major relevant part job can offer them a chance to practice the knowledge learned in the university.  University [***] students are mostly [***] students have many subjects to learn, so it is impossible to spend a lot of time, [***] my major is computer science.  For example, if we come - we have more than [***] studying time to finish the homework.  There is opportunity to put our knowledge into practice [***] question after [***] only basic one.  If we can find a part-time job in software company, we can learn how to make up all the program as a student and do some advanced program.  It will be benefit our study back in the university.


I disagree because when you are a college student of course you have a lot of time from your lectures because you're still a student and we have duty for studying and not for working.  But when we are end term student it's good for us to have a part-time job because it can kill the foreign situation and then we can spend our time to have useful – useful – useful things for – for – for our activities...


Having a part-time job is very good for a college student because they could train their – their self so their - they can be more skillful to work and also we - we could try to – to work and have – have money for – for ourselves so we are not a burden for – for our parents.

We also share knowledge – our knowledge to other people and we could – we could have lot of friends from – from our place – place of work and we could – we could realize that working and taking money is not – is not as easy as we thought.  Maybe – maybe some of us thought that – that money is...


...job after graduation and actually and having a part-time job make us know the real – the real world and students [***] apply their knowledge in the work, so part-time job is important for college student for real work and apply the knowledge when they go in college.  I think that's why I agree with college student can have a part-time – a part-time job.  And especially when we – when – when having a part-time, we can get...


I agree that college student can have the part-time job for some reasons.  First, the student can get extra money from their salary.  They can spend money to buy something that they like and they don't have to ask money from their parents.  It is very helpful to lessen the economical burden of our parents.

Second, it will ease me to get the job after I graduated from college.  By having experience of working before, I am sure that the company will easily accept me.  In this modern era, most of our companies hire people who already had an experience in working before because these people had already learned how to deal with a difficult job working and they can work better.  This will elevate my knowledge as English department student and to elevate my knowledge in English language.  For example, if I work as a private course teacher, I will be able to share my knowledge that I get in college by teaching English to my students.  Also, by teaching English, I will always remember the material I learned and being a smart student and also I will also...


And third they are trained to be the real worker, and fourth it will increase their experience, and as my experience I am the one of the college who have a part-time job and I am like - I am kind of person who want to explore new experience because in the new – if they do part-time jobs they can have a new environment, new friends and they will join to be employ and they – they have to maintain their time, their – their money, and it can also - they can know the real world of the worker and know the real world of job and that's why my experience - I am being like waiter in coffee shop and I was teaching students and I was...


As I told you before there – a part-time job is a parent's savior because parents can save their money for their living other than to give the children and also it will help you to be more mature to face the real world because with your own money you can use it anything and you can like - let's say you can be more responsible with your own salaries.  And also it will give you kind of experience and you will not be so shocked if you face the real world in real job - and what to say then – and so part-time job - part-time job is not – is I think is not...


Yeah, I agree with that statement.  Another – another reason is if the student is come from poor family it will help them so much because the student can also – can also learn about the real job that they will face in the future after the college.  That is my statement about part-time jobs, okay.  Then, it is so much help for their parents and also for themselves - for the students themselves...


Part-time job - part-time job also can – can allow us to share our knowledge that we get.  For example, if we - if we become teacher in study guidance we can share our knowledge that we get from elementary until high school.  And then it is become easier if we - if we search for the job after we graduate because we have experience in working.  Example for part-time job are become private teacher, online business, and entrepreneurship.  They are...


I agree that students must have a part-time job.  But there is many advantages and disadvantages, and advantages the first is you don't have to ask your parents to – to ask for - give you some extra money and you can help the parents' economy, you don't have to ask your parents and especially for the students in boarding house or those who live far from parents.  Then because we have own salary we can buy everything that we want to buy and that gives advantages if we have to share our time with study...


I agree.  We need money to live, so we can get the money, we have to get work.  Then - however, for they didn't like me to work in full-time job, it is hard to me.  So I need a part-time job.  Part-time job is [***] for us to - and [***] work, so we need to practice our - how can - how we handle ourselves.  So you can say we learn...


I agree because a student has a part-time work and she - in order to buy food with herself from her money with - with her salary from this work, and he has - he has - another activity - another - another activity in our - in another - in another university and he has some more [***] from this work and...


I am definitely agree that we - we are as a student in the college have to have a part-time job because I am a full-time job, not only for part-time job but I am a full-time worker job.  Because - why I am agree, because I will get more experiences, more friends, more knowledge about how to build a good relationship with others because when we have a part-time job, we should make a good schedule, we have to arrange for our schedule - when we have to focus on the work, when we have to focus on the study in college.  We have to make our homework, we have to make our task, we have to make our planning, we have to make a report, we have to make our - arrange some – some things - in a good - good schedule because we have to build something immediately there, but it doesn't matter for me because I am a full-time...


I think I agree because a professional student or college student must have a job to pay for their life - their life and their college.  So they not make their parents to pay their daily life and their college.  And I think professional student will have work when they are studying in college can become a successful person or businessman.  In the future, as you know, I am still not having a job, but I want to having a job because I want to learn about business and get experience from my work.  Also how to solve problem in business.  I hope I can get job so I am not made my parents working hard for paying my college and my daily life.


I think student should not have part-time job because he should focus on the study.  If student have a part-time job, he needs to decide the time, their mind on work and study.  As long as their parent could pay, I think student should not have to work.  Otherwise, the student or their parent could not pay for their study, maybe they should go to work.


Part-time job is effective to spend a few day of college student.  It can make money for college student and they can have some - they can get more experience about - in the job life, and they can - and they can make - they can have - make new friends too.  But if they didn't want to take the part-time job, they may - they must be...


I think I agree with that because if the student has part-time job, they can have much money to buy anything.  If they want to - for study, he can pay for study by himself and then maybe it is good - it is good for they because - can learn - they can learn about job.  Yeah, I think that's all.


I think a job in college may not seem ideal.  A job would not make things easier.  However, a job could be one of the most beneficial experience one could have in college.  With a job, student understand the value of money, time management, working with other, preparing for interviews and being a leader.  This kind of experience is invaluable to students wanting to enter the working world after college.  And studying for work - studying for work with - while attending college, there are many benefits that go along with having the responsibility of school.  Along with the commitment and expectation of work, student work - student work during college...


Absolutely disagree because nowadays a lot of students this doesn't work.  I mean a part-time job is worse.  It will be impact your - I mean study, yeah.  It will be impact your study when you go to work for money or nothing.  Your parents pay your university for sure, what you worry about.  Yeah, I know sometimes the - the people - I mean, poor, yeah.  Yeah, sometime, if you poor, it necessary it, but if you don't - if you not poor, don't do that because it will be impact your study as I can tell you.  That's bad idea.


I am agree with that state - statement because a student who have part-time - part-time job get a lot of experience from their - their work, and they can be independent and they can pay their study for themselves, and it's good to be student who have part-time job.  Yeah, because I am a student with part-time job too.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah, it can improve their skill because they have lot of experience.


I agree about part-time job.  For me, I think that it's very important in our life, especially in my life.  I never think that - I never think how much money that I got, but too many experience and knowledge that I can learn I think and I have few friends and then I can get many new information and [***] we study in the college - in the class, but also in the society.  It looks different between college students to have part jobs or not after they graduate their school - because after they graduate if they - if they...


Okay, I am agree because we have part-time job can help us to get more experience and we can get more pocket money than before.  So we have money without asking the parents.  And I am disagree if it is school and part-time job - part-time job is on, it will make us more tired than not we just a student and we have time to learn just...


I agree if the college student have a part-time job so it - they can help their parents to pay their college fee so they don't need to ask parents for more money and make parents feel must have to work hard.  So it's good even if there's lot of part-time jobs that will be given to the college student but yet they must manage their time so they not neglecting their college and yet they can focus on it so they get part-time job and do the college and effectively and not disturbing one or another.  If they are to preserve the part-time job, it will make the college to get bad mark.


Yeah, actually I agree that some students should have their own part-time job because it [***] so they will get their own money beside from their parents because there is so much - so much thing that he should - he should have, he should buy, and the money is required.  So by doing part-time job, they can fulfill everything that what they want, even it's not very important, maybe for some enjoyable thing or maybe they can saving money for their future so they don't have to...


I am partially agree with college student to do a part-time job because we can't just make them to not do the job, maybe they need the money to continue their study, to pay their study fee, so I think that part-time - a part-time job is really to do if they really need money.  And then they can learn to be - to earn money by themselves, it's a good thing I think and I am partially disagree with it because maybe they - if they tend to do part-time seriously, they tend to think that now...


Okay, I need some - I - I think some people need to go in the part-time job, why - because his or her parent cannot give school for his kid or his children, and if we go to the part-time job, we can get some money and if we get some money, the money then make me do - make me happy, and with money, we can go in the mall and walk with friend and having fun, and...


Okay, I think part-time job is very important because many people want to get more money for their - their family, their children, and sometimes children also want to work at part-time job because their - they want to get more good to having fun, working hard, and it - with their friends and [***] is important in this world with...


Part-time is - of all - something, yes, [***] part-time job for work- for student, and kind of - thinking about job but, you know, job make a profit for the - this time, and then, you know, part-time job is [***] for the real job.


I agree about part-time job, and I think part-time job is good because many people have part-time job and more – many money, maybe for his or her family or his or her [***] and that money of course can be used for everything.  For example, it can be used for food, some drinks [***] or maybe it can be [***] because there is no one – will not one money for his or her life and for me money is everything.  [***] I agree about part-time job because in part-time we can get many experience and we can have new friends.


I think I agree with this statement because you know some students have less - what is it, what's called - less pay to pay their university fee tuition so I think part-time is the best way for them to get more money.  And then I think the positive effect is to get them experience to be a good leader in the future because, you know, in a work place, you can know how to manage our time and how to be a good leader in the future.  So, I think it's good for student to make - what is it - to make another...


I do agree with the - the college students to have part-time job.  Why? Because I have been saying that when - there are some advantages that can be taken from having that part-time job.  First one is of course related with financial - financial part.  Students can have more pocket money if they have part-time jobs.  Of course, if - when they - when they did it - when they do part-time job, is they - they are supposed not to disturb their study and the second one is they can - the students can learn about how to work with the others.  It is something that they can – that cannot be learned in the university.  It is very important thing when they are - when they are going to work in the society.  They can learn how to have team work, how to manage their time, how to learn...


In my country, English is needed for part-time job because I - I have experience to became teacher for – for children because nowadays in children's education, English is the - English became the most important lesson to the children because in this globalization, English is needed to use in every field of life and also every field of job.  And also in job, English is become the main point of requirement to be fulfilled so that the applicant can settle in the job where they apply.


I am totally agree with the part-time job because it will become a good - good occasion for the student to be - to be more independent and to not ask for money from their parents.  So part-time job - part-time also provided the student with new - new challenge and new experience in the middle in what their studies about or in the new field that they never know before.  Part-time - part-time job really, really important for the student, especially - especially for...


I agree with the students who take part-time job because of several reasons.  The first reason is because the student who take part-time job they will - they can develop their skills.  For example, for the student who takes educational department, they can develop their skill of teaching by taking the part-time job like - maybe become the tutor or - private tutor I mean.  And the next reason is because they can be independent - they can be independent by taking part-time job because they can make money by themselves.  They - they have the chance to make money and...


Also, it's really helpful for job and it's real give them skill to do hard work and knowledge and do with society.  So that's why I agree that part-time job is very important for the student when they are studying in the university.  Yeah, like - when I was in the junior of my university, I also teach some children in the private office.  I am the [***] and I got some job that it is part-time job and I get very useful experience for this kind of activity, that's why I will get part-time job.  Part-time job is very important for the student when you are studying at the university.


My opinion for college student to have a part-time job is a very brilliant idea because truthfully, we are as student, we only - that is - we only read books and only learning in the class without knowing what people do out there because we are - is prepared to be workers but if we - we do - we are trained to work - we - we will have no experience at all.  And, yeah, that will be it.


Okay, I think I agree with college student having a part-time job.  Actually, I – I want - I want to have part-time job too because the part-time job, I think it have many benefit for college student, something like - the college student can have self-authority on managing this time, the - the financial - like the money, they have salary from the part-time job, it can make - can help the college student to have time management ability and time...


I – I agree with the statement that nowadays more student choose to take part-time job and I - I believe that a part-time job could help student deepen their understanding of knowledge they learn in university and be more mature.  At first, taking a part-time job can offer them a chance to practice the knowledge learned in the university.  University designed the curriculum for student are mostly theoretical.  Since students have many subjects to learn, so I think it's difficult to spend a lot of time [***] take my major computer science for example.  Every term we have more than five subjects to learn.  It takes us almost all the studying time to finish the homework.


I disagree because if you are college student but of course you have a lot of tasks from your lecturer so I think when college student have - a college student has part-time job, maybe it will disturb his or her study and - but when they are – arisen – arisen term student, it's that good because it can - it can spend their time and for kill boring situation because when they are writing thesis, of course they have...


I agree with – with the topic that college students should have a part-time job because with having the part-time job, the college student can be more responsible of their self.  They also can be independent because they – they could collect money for their pocket money to buy something they need so they - they are not like burdensome to their parents.  It also like - it is - it is good for us to - to - it is good for us to prepare ourselves before we - we are working in the -in the real – real world of work because we used to be work since we - we are in a college.  We can also share...


And the second is we can get more friends and further our relation – I mean like in - having a part-time job, we can get more friends, we can get new experience and share our knowledge and our experience with the – with the friends, and the third is it help us to get a job after graduation because nowadays, many office need students who have a lot of experience - lot of experience rather than a student who don't have any experience such as who don't have any experience in work, then having a part-time job help us to easily to get a job and having a part-time job is a kind of a way to...


I agree that college student can have a part-time job for some reasons.  First, the student can get extra money from their salary.  They can spend the money to buy something that they like and they don't have to ask money to their parents.  It is very helpful to lessen the economical burden of our parents.  Second, it will be easy to get a job after I graduated from college.  By having the experience of working before, I am sure that the company will easily accept me.  In this modern era, most of our companies hire people who already had an experience in working before because people had already known how to deal with the difficulty of working and they can work better.  It would – I will be able to use my knowledge as English department student and to elevate my knowledge in English language.  For example, if I work as a private college teacher, I will be able to share my knowledge that I get in college by teaching English to my students.  Also, by teaching English...


I agree that college students can have part-time job for some reasons.  At first, I agree that college student can have like part-time job because at first they are able to get their own money because with part-time job, they can get money from their own self.  And secondly, and financially, they can help their parents even it's only a bit.  They are trained to - and third, they are trained to be real workers, and like when they do part-time job, they will map like reality of worker, like in campus or in college, they only meet their friends, students, and like daily activity...


I agree with the student who take a part-time job because they - I think their parents save here.  For example, my sister is a master degree student, but she has also a part-time job as a designer.  And - so she can manage her salary and my parents can save their money for their old times.  And second, it can help them to get better job in future because they have experience and company will like to consider for those who had an experience, either works in organization or part-time job.  And like it will make you feel respectful - respectful from what you have done.  You will feel happy...


I agree with that statement as long as the part-time job does not disturbing the lecture time.  And besides that, part-time job has some positive things.  The first thing is the student can help their – their parents, help the family economy.  And second, he or she can learn how to be an independent person and prepare themselves to – to face the real - the real job after - after the school - after university, after college.


I agree with this topic because part-time job from college students have so many benefits for them.  For example, part-time job for college student can help the - can help their parents.  Their parents - their parents do not - do not fulfill their – their children's needs in the boarding house because boarding house students need so many – so many things.  By – by part-time job students can fulfill their needs.  Second, by part-time job for college students is improve their friends.


I agree that the students must have part-time job because there is many advantages - but there is many advantages and these advantages itself and the first advantages is you can help the parents' economy so you don't have to ask your parents for extra money, especially for those who live in boarding house or live far from the parents.  And then because we have own salary, we can buy everything that we want to buy.  For example, from my own experience, I can buy my own hand phone, the cell phone, from my first salary, and for the...


Part-time job is also useful for us to enter the world of work so you could be – we learn to work first before we live in the work we are going to live.  Part-time job can also make us more self-sufficient so we don't always rely on parents to take care of us and we can prove to others that we are able to live independently because we have been able to take care of ourselves, so part-time job is more - part-time job make us more self-sufficient to our life – to our life and then it is...


I agree because college students have values to help them – to help them [***] by this [***] by or whatever needed from studying of what to needed to earn from [***] parents [***] help – help – help to – help ourselves with [***]


I am definitely agree about we are as a student in the college to have a part-time job because I am a full-time work, not just for part-time but I am a full-time worker.  I am work as one of the company in Indonesia.  I have to work at 8 AM till 5 PM and then I have to go to our – to my college at 6 PM till 10 PM.  In here I will have to arrange and have to make a schedule because I have to focus on the some things, my work and my study.

I am agree because I will get more experiences, more friends, more knowledge of how to build a good relationship with others, how to make a profit, how to make a good socialization because when we have a part-time job we should have a good schedule actually.  When we have to make a good schedule, we will arrange for them, we have to focus on it, and then we will get a better...


Yeah, I think it's very important for professional or college student to having a part-time job because I think a professional student must have a job to pay for their daily life and their college.  So, they not make their parents to pay their daily life and their college, and I think professional student will have to work when they are studying in college and become a successful person or businessman in the future.  As you know, I am still have – still not having a job, but I want to having a job because I want to learn about business and get experience from my work.  Also, I have to solve problems in business.  I hope I can get job.  So, I not make my parents working hard for paying my college and my daily life.


I think a student should not have part-time job because if she or he have a part-time job it will divide their time, their mind to his work or her work and the study.  As far as the parents should save for their studying class, I think it's just student should focus to studying, otherwise their parents or their relation could be for the college - they - for they study - maybe some students should have part-time job to pay their study because studying – studying means...


Part-time job is perfectly to spend a full day for college students.  It can make own money for college students and they can having fun to get more experience in job life and they can have some experience.  First is students want to search a part-time job very much in discipline [***] because studying and working at the same time can – can consume much time and energy [***].


I am agree with that because part-time job it can - they can learn about how they get a job and then they can learn – learn something new, get experience with the job and then they can have money, they themselves and it can – it can...


Students who work while attending college, there are many benefits that go along with having the responsibility of school along with the commitment and expectation of work.  Students who work during college learn time management well, good character and building there is some - for future employment.  It is important to refer to see you skills and experience when you are in college so that you will be well grounded and be more likely to meet the expectation of future employers.  Working can also allow you to make connection with companies or business within your study of interest.  Opportunities like this will give you a competitive advantage and set you apart from other.


Don't ever do that because your family have a cost - lot of cost - you know - I mean your family is taking your cost a lot - maybe in some case poor - poor people their family can't pay the cost, for sure they can get to part-time job, but it guess it's a bad idea because it will be impact your study and your time - you will be exhausted - totally exhausted, don't do that ever.  That's all I can talk, but maybe in addition could have...


Yeah, they can get - I am agree with the statement they don't need to – to ask money from their parent because they – they have salary from their job and it's good because they can buy anything by their self.  It make student who have part-time job independent to suffice money.  They get experience and they will be more wise to spend their money because...


Yeah, I agree with the part-time job.  I think that's very important in our life.  I think in real life I never think how much money we got but how much experience and knowledge that I can learn every day and [***] only in the class but also in society life, so it looks different between the students college - the college students to have part job after they graduate their school.  They can easily get the job for the future and then they can get more information in the future, and they can have new friends.  So, I agree about this.  I very enjoy to have part job.


I am agree with the statement because part-time job for students it can give knowledge and experience in the future or help him afterwards and we can get more pocket money that we get us our parents.  For example, we can use our money to pay for or hang out with our friends.  So, according to me, students with part-time job is not bad.


I agree if the college student has part-time job so they can help parents to pay their college fee so they don't need to ask for more money or they can also have some money to spend for their daily life or may be to hang out with friends.  So, they don't need – don't ask for more money from the parents, so it's good to have a part-time job if they are - but they must divide time between part-time job and the college so they don't make part-time job is more important than college because study is number one and secondly is job.  That's why it's still part-time so don't need to be focus on part-time, yet you must focus on study college.  That's why part-time - yes it's maybe – maybe I agree, but not to focus on part-time because it will be bad for...

They think that they can earn money so easily, they tend to choose to work rather than studying in college.  But I think if they really want to pay their study fee they can just study hard and then get scholarship rather than to do job that can break your concentration and their study.  So, I think that they – they can do a part-time job as long as they – they still can concentrate on their studies in – in their college because they think that they - part-time job can be – can be distraction and I think that it's not good to continue their part-time job.


I think some people need doing the part-time job, why?  Because not every parent can get children or his or her kids go to the school because not – not have money and if we go to the part-time job, we can get some money and if we get some money we can go work in the mall and have – have fun with my friend and with money we can try – come out with - and we can come out with and we will happy.

So, students have to get more money from the other experience and then the positive effect is to make them to be a good leader in the future by using the experience that they are getting from the job in the part-time job and then it will be good for their work time in their country.  I think that's all and then I agree...


I do agree with the students who have part-time jobs.  Why?  Because part-time jobs can get more – can give some advantages for the students.  The first one is they can - part-time job can support their financial matter.  It can give more pocket money for the students so they can buy something that they want and they can't get from their parents.

Also, it – it will make student more independent.


I think taking the part-time job for the students is really important for them to improve therefore their skills in their field.  For example, the student who take educational department like me for example I take educational English department, so I can take the part-time job like being the private tutor who can teach the children - the students of junior high school or senior high school teaching them English.  It is very influential for me because I can develop my English teaching skill by doing this kind of part-time job.
