In my opinion, I think doing the part-time job while you're in college is important because it's – it's a way – it's the way to practice your skills even though you're not in the – in the kind of – you – you do the job that is same as what you're studying in the – in the university.  I think it's a good opportunity to – to do some other stuff to gain some ex – experience in – in your life.  But honestly for me, I didn't – I haven't do – I didn't use to do any part-time jobs now.  But I – but I think I wonder somehow I can try one of the – one of the part-time job, maybe I can do as a waiter in some restaurant because I used to help my family.

Yes, I agree with that because if you do your work or the part-time job while you study at a university, you have many, many skill from that because it's very hard to work and study together.  You will have to separate time to work and study [***] suitable.  You will have many, many skill from the article because [***] le – leadership, the passion or the [***], yes, it's very, very important skill in your life if you graduate from the university, you will have a good [***] you will have [***] you will have a le – leader, yeah.

About pa – part-time job, student or bachelor that have to do a part-time job because – uhh – uhh – maybe he or she have to do a part-time job because he has no money or his or her parent is not rich much to send her to study or maybe he want money to do something that [***] go on vacation, go hangout with – with his or her friend for [***] he do part-time job.  Maybe he had like to buy a bike or motor – uhh – bike, motorbike – uhh – maybe he want to buy a bicycle to trans – uhh – transport – uhh – uhh – slightly, so – uhh – maybe he want to do for his future or...

Okay.  I agree for the college student that has the part-time job [***] part-time job is one way to learn and take a new experience, so they can take experience on their work with the real work that outside the classroom, first.  The second reason for have your part-time job, part-time job is one of the way that they can learn how to get the money and spend it on itself, but it's another way for reduce the weight of the loading on their parents.  They can get back themselves [***] and learn how to use it.  However, they can be use it on their hobby on the way we think that...

I agree with their speech that some students must do part-time job for help their parents.  And I think this – they will help them about working skill – working skill, communication skill and they will have some experience and realize that val – the value of mon – money and understand – understand their parents more about to – a – making money for – for them to study like a – to travel [***] I think...

Umm – I think part-time job is not – a – so important, so I disagree with this question.  In Thailand, not many students have to work part-time job because I don't know why, but I think that we all have – like they have enough money and part-time job in Thailand is not really – I don't know.  I think it's not – it's from my opinion I think it's not that safe for a girl to do part-time jobs like at night, I don't know.  And I think that it's – it's – there is also time because you are so...

I disagree with this – that statement.  It – a – when I – when we are students, we need to spend the time for the study in the field you love, not spend the time for their part-time job.  If you – if you don't have money, you can contact your university for – for the money to study in – a...

Okay.  I agree with part-time job because it can help poor children [***] observation for many, many children – children for – in every region of country.  In Thailand, I have many, many poor people, but they want to be a good [***] good education, so part-time job, you can make – you can make them to be good [***].  And part-time job, you can choose [***] many, many...

A – I think it is my opinion, I dis – I agree with – a – the student go to have a part-time in the time, do you study because I think part-time is very good for – a – student have no money to – to small [***] – spend.  I think part-time is – a – good for family that no money because – uh – in my university – for example, in my university, in – in the days, at least I have – I – I prepare money to play water sport.  It's more than money, but some family, there is no more than money to – [***] to me and my father, I think part-time is good that I will...

I agree with a part-time job student because we can take time for useful.  We can – it may – make a – the right time to work, to study, to play and to relax, so I think the part-time job is more important than all these student who does – who all these study in the class because part-time give us a big experience.  For me, I have a part-time job when the semester is [***].  I work at [***].  I do – I did it for 3 months for – for the first semester.  And after that, I got a big experience.

I agree with this idea that it is important for college student to have a part-time job because if you used to work or do anything that – any people don't [***] use to – yeah, you will have more experience than other college students.  [***] in the future, you have to work actually, yeah.  And if you used to work, you will have more experience and your boss or company will consider you more than other people, yeah, and make money for you.  When you grow up, you have to [***] spend many, many, many money [***] that you have to make money for this.

Yes, I agree with doing a part-time job because I think – a – when student have a part-time job, they must have more discipline or – and – and more diligent to – to do his work and study in the same time – a – is – is – make the – the student improve their skill and management of time.  And – and – and doing a part-time job is – can make them no value of money.

I agree because the student should have to [***].  And for me, student should have part-time to job.  If you work [***], have a good [***] when they are talking, that mean [***] can – can think a lot of thing.  If you help student, then [***] and feel good.  So the children should have a job time.  The teacher or family should have a job time for your children every day.  Your children must have a good time in their life when they are talking.  Every children...

And we get – well, I agree that student make a part-time [***] student use the free time in – have – have a money [***] them – themselves and not to – not to try talents and I – I [***] in part-time and I – I think it's a good – it's a good [***] student in part-time...

I agree because students who work on campus is good.  To train yourself to be [***] and train us to work, it is the training we learn about to work.  It's make us better than anyone else.  [***] there are no people that will get [***] with new friend, new family and good friend.  They also have money [***] because I want to part-time job, but I don't doing – I don't doing is [***] to learn English.

Nowadays a – student have a chance to bring the part-time job in – in the – the lives and I'm not agree and I'm just agree with it because – we, human, have – should have one objective to live industrial [***].  When you have the part-time job, you have to – you wanted your time into doing the part-time job and study in your university.  I – I'm university student.  And study in the university is tough – is too tough to work and – with a company, so like a mechanical engineering, we have the project every week.  So every – every weekend, we have to take our time to finish this up.

I agree with the statement that student in university should have a part-time job while they're studying in university.  But I will disagree if that part-time job that they're going to do doesn't relate or involve with the thing that they're learning or they're studying, for example if you're in – an engineering student, if you're engineering student, you should do the job that we will improve your engineering skills, not the job that just service or something like that.  If they get paid in the job that they're doing well, so a – the – a – engineering that – job that improve your engineering skill and if they get paid – get paid as much as they deserve, so it is useful for them to do...

Hello.  I think the part time job is good.  I – I agree with students that can do part time job.  Student can work for experience and practice themselves and use their time wisely and can make – can help family make money although student must allocate for part time job, yeah student...
Okay your topic is, in – in the college do you accept with college do a part time job?  Let me think about it.  I think that I agree with this topic because the – the student of the college can be made more experience in their classroom and they will know and they will meet a new friend at the part time job for example part time job of college student I think that it is a waiter I think it is cool choice for student because...
Yeah I agree with you because I think part time can make money for yourself you can have money, accept money of your parents and I think you can choose term makes advantage you can work part time in – in off semester or holidays.  Part time don't – don't make education this is if your attention to study I think Thailand part time are unpopular because Thai people like to work between society [***] and [***] you until you get it all [***].
The part time job I think the part time job is good for students in the college because it makes the excellent before graduation get the new friends, know the handling of many people get the new social and get the money for share the work for me and my family, but we can't have job done that impact to study in the college and so we should allocate the time so don't make that [***] to study so a part time job is good for -- 
I agree – I agree on this topic, because – um – I think the student who will study in the college is old enough to – uh – take care of themselves.  They'll have to – making money not just only ask for their parents – um – if the – they have experience in work in a part-time job; when they finish their study they will have – uh – enough experience to do their job – um –  and – but I think it is – is – uh – too much – too much time – uh – too much time for the jobs they will...
Okay, I really agree that – um –college student need a part-time job – need to do a part-time job because – um – it mean that they use – uh –they manage their time wisely, and – uh – moreover they – um –don't need to ask parents for money because they can earn money by themselves, so they know that – um – uh –money is hard to find so – um –they appreciate the value of money.  Um, but one thing that's – uh – more important than – um – than – then they know that they earn money by themselves is that – um – the experience and it does help when you do your – um – your future career such – um...
I agree with the statement, because I have two reason; the first reason, yes, if the path is related to the thing is that you are trying it will help or support me to do more work experience.  The second reason is it can make money on their own; do not become a burden on parents and not interfere – interfere with learning.  The confusion is – uh – that if proper part-time job relate to the field of study in itself, and must not interfere with learning and have money...
People say that today the college student had to be work in part-time job.  I disagree the student – uh – uh – study hard, and not everybody that have free time to do the part-time job, but do the part-time job is good, because you can use your free time for – for – you can use your free time to work and gain the money but I think most of the student – uh – study hard and have more homework, and they don't have time to do the part-time jobs.  But, I think well some of student...
A – as I said in the previous – previous talk, I was – I was talking about my – my chance if they can – if they can enter to do some part-time jobs.  A – for me, I think I – I want to try to be a waiter in the part-time job because I think I like to do something like do the – do service to other people and make them – make them happy.  When I make – when I make my customer happy, I also feel happy too.  And I – I – I also think about when – if I can be a singer in the – in some kind of cafe or restaurant in the – in – in night, in the nighttime, I think it's kind of great – a – because for me, I like to – I like to sing a song and I think I can...

Yeah, yeah, that [***] I think that I said their work I learn together, it's very, very hard from you, but you can do it.  You – you'll be – you will become a good guy.  You can become the [***] guy.  We have a skill suitable for that because when you do a part-time job, it's our – not many job if you learn any of the [***] you will gain many, many experience from that if [***] for your future because you haven't experience from that, you will have a – a handle with the problem that you can figure it by yourself.  If you can [***] very, very easy to take it in your future if [***] do a part-time job in the study.

So about part-time job, it's important for student that want to do.  But if student have a – his parent have enough money to send him to buy anything and – and have enough money to send him to study, so he don't have to – don't have to do a part-time job for – for – in free time.  He – he may be focused on study and get – a – more, more – mo – mo – mo – more knowledge to improve their knowledge, so this is focused on study, he may be – smart and he may be – a – a – good – good [***] in the future.

Okay, I agree with [***] college student have the part-time job for two reasons.  First reason is on the [***] and the way to get some knowledge.  They can learn new things on the part-time job.  They can learn to work.  They can learn to – by the way we work with each other.  And they will find how – how to do shopping [***] for them.  The second reason is on the money.  So they will learn how to get the money with themselve and they can [***].  They will know how to spend it [***] themselve and know the value of that money that they would like to spend.  [***] but they will learn that [***].

I agree that college student have to do some part-time job when doing their study because I think if – if they have free time, they – they – they should do that for – for help their parents.  I think this is – that is actually will help them about working skill or communicate with another people and they will have experience.  And the important point I think they will realize the value of money.  And they will understand their parent about making money for them to use [***]...

Okay, so I disagree with the importance of the part-time job.  I think in Thailand, we don't have much of part-time jobs to do like the part-time job that I can think of now is just work in 7-Eleven, but I think that it a waste of time like studying in college is already hard and we also have to prepare for homework and for the next class like we have just done for ourselves.  And for the money in my opinion, we already have enough money.  We don't need that much money for part-time jobs – in part-time jobs.  And by doing part-time jobs, it [***]...

I'm disagree with the stat – with the statement.  When we are student, we need to spend time for study for good grade and good job in the future, not spend the part time for the part-time job because it make you [***].  You can – you can – a – we can read the book and study more.  If you don't – a – don't have a part-time job, if you don't have money – a –we – we can contact the university for the...

Okay.  Part-time job is good.  I – I agree – I agree with – a – my friends or my brother or my sister do it.  A part-time job is can [***] them to be good idea [***] good grade because if – a – they can learn – learn about – learn about a life in everyday from part-time job.  Okay, I'm...

Yes, in my opinion, I think I agree with your statement because part-time is good for the people that want [***] more money to – a – there is no more money to [***] to the student in the family to go to the university.  I have my friends [***].  Every day in the evening, he is go to part-time.  That is good.  He have more activities and he can – a – [***] people, [***] culture with the customers.  He go to – a – a – go to the work that he [***] that, for example my friends part-time at 7-Eleven.  She is have...

The part-time job for me is very important because I'm the one who have a part-time job after I have – I – after I finished class, maybe after I finished the semester [***], I have a part-time job at department store.  I work about [***].  I got a big experience after I work.  The part-time job give me – give my brain politer [***].  I open my mind.  I accept more people.  I know that the hardest thing to understand is people because people is different.  We have to open our mind and accept their mind and respect their mind more...

[***] the last time, I agree with this idea that it is important for – for student, you have the part-time job because when you study in the – in the university, you have many free time without money and you will have to find some hobby or some part-time job to make your free time – to have benefit and [***] more than people yet and it's make you have more experience than other people.  And this is when you go up, you have to work a lot [***] and spend many, many money, yeah, that you can [***].

I really agree about doing a part-time job because the students is can make the student – a – we're right that money that they earned by their self – how is value above for them.  And they have money to buy thing that they want because I think I'm – I'm a student.  When I grow up, I need to [***] a lot of things, a – a little stuff that I really need and doing part-time job make the students help more discipline and – and...

I agree because the children should have to relax [***].  The children should have a part-time job.  If we'll work, then have a good [***] when they are talking, [***] can think a lot of things.  If we'll help children to relax and feel good, so the student should have a talk-time.  The teacher or family should have a job time for your children every day.  Your children [***] have a good time in the [***] when they are talking. Every children like to have fun.

I'm agree in topic of part-time, many people have a part-time, but it's not – nothing [***] student, but worker in part-time.  Now I – I think – I think people have a view – people use the free time [***] good, so make a money fast – faster than no part-time.  I – I want to part-time, but I not – I...

If [***] the from work to pay you for [***] and hangout [***].  I want to work during [***].  I don't have time.  And unfortunately, even at the university, it's very [***].  I have all the [***] homework.  I do not like homework.  It's got me to sleep [***] when it is time to sleep in the room.  I'm slowly.  I'm slowly really because sleep, I don't know.  I don't understand [***] for me.  My teacher is...

In my opinion, I dis – I disagree with it because in our student life, we have like one – more than one thing to do like – a – revising your lecture, your – a – your knowledge for exam.  And I'm third year student now.  I don't have a chance even to go to do my hobby like I – like when I – when I – in high school period.  So if you take your time to do more about – a – part-time job, you don't have a chance to enjoy yourself and revise the book, so I disagree to have a part-time job for student because...

Just like I have said they should do the part-time job that relate to or involve with the thing that they're studying – a – if you're an engineering student, you should do job that will improve engineering skill and also they – they should get paid as much as they deserve.  If they get a low paid, they will find – maybe they will find another job and if they get paid well – that they get paid well, but they will not improve any skill that relate or involve with the thing that they're studying, so I am – I agree with the statement, but you should support them to get the right job and get paid as much as they deserve because in the university if you'll do the part-time job and you're doing and you're studying, it is a hard thing.

I agree with part time job.  Student can work  --  can work part time job because it is use their time wisely.  Besides student okay, and used their time wisely and can help our family and receive experience and practice them.  Although student allocate [***] for part time, but they receive -- 
Okay your topic is if college can do a part time job?  Yes I think I agree with this topic because the college student can be made more experienced by yourself and they can learn the outside of [***] that teacher cannot get for example I think that part time job of college is they can be a waiter I think that it's a good choice because in  --  in the nearby university there are many restaurants, yes; however, they can meet a new friend too.  I think it is very good.
Okay, part time job I – I agree with you because I think part time can make money for yourself.  You can have money except money of your parents.  You can serve part time in all semester or holiday weekends.  Part time don't – don't make education easy because if you attention – attention to study I think talent [***] part time and popular.  I think if you have part time job your friends all they will allow you using your [***] with this is opinion of me and as my parents will [***].
I think the part time job is good for building in the college because it may be excellent before graduation get the new friends, know there have been [***] many people, get many new social and get the [***] for sharing work to me and my family but will part time job does bad impact to study in the college so we should allocate the time for the next bad impact to study.  Well, so part time job is good for students in the college if we know a school  --  a college that has with [***] become a good adult in the future -- 
Uh.  For the topic that is the part-time job and the student in the college.  If – um – I – I just an – answer that I agree with the topic, but if they do too much – uh – part-time job they will – cannot take care of their study very well then I think they have to – to – um – uh – take care with – manage their time – their time between study and do the job.  Yes – um – if something take much time than the other thing they will not receive the good probably of – of the two things.
Uh, when we talk about a part-time job – um – we can – we can earn some money that – that from – from the – from the work, and – um –it can boost the – our confidence to – um –to have fun within the limit of our paycheck, but the benefits – uh – uh – rather than the amount of paycheck because we will have – um –we can manage our skills and – um –we must understand the responsibility and we can apply it to our daily life.  Um – uh – the experience in workplace that – um – it's very – it's very attractive to – for our future career after our graduate – graduation.  I am talking about the time management – um – the...
I think I agree with the statement, because – um – I have – uh – two patients – uh – sorry I have two reason.  The first is, if the path – uh – is to really your study in, it will help support you to more work experience.  Um, the second reason is it can make money to you – uh – do not become a burden on parents and not interfere with learning.  The confusion is that if the part-time job relate to your field of study in itself and must not interfere with learning.
I think the student – college – college student; some – some of them have study hard and have more homework, and cannot be – do the part-time job, but some of the student – uh – have free time and want to gain the experience for their work or gain the money and they will want to work on part-time job.  But I think the – especially of college student they are just more study hard than the – the other, and I think they can do the part-time job but if it have the opportunities I think they will do the part-time job, sure.
