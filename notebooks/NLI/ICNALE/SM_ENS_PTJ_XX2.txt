I agree that it is important for some university students to have a part-time job.  For some of them, it helps them to get out what they like to do and what they are good at and it can help them find a good full-time job in the future.  Maybe they can start out part-time and find a company that they would like to work in a full-time when they have more time after graduation, and in my experience I don't think they study very much any way so they definitely have the free time.  Um, most of them are just kind of wasting a lot of time at universities here and are not being challenged, and they are squandering the big lead they have over the rest of the world in education by spending in a Japanese university.  Um, so yeah, they might as well make some extra money while they are at it and sometimes you find out you didn't really like something, some kind of a job you thought you might like and it is better to find that out when you are working part-time then to find it out during your actual career, so I think more than....
The question is, do I agree or disagree whether college students should have part-time jobs?  I guess – ahem, excuse me – it depends on the student and their circumstances, but I think generally I would have to agree that a part-time job is appropriate and a good – good training for college students.  Studying at university or college allows students to, uh, access their skills in a – in an educational environment.  Having a part-time job teaches college students the value of work and allows them to set a budget and to achieve some measure of success in working in – in the real world as opposed to the so-called ivory tower of an educational institution.
I agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job for many reasons.  The first reason is that students need to spend time outside of the university setting and academic learning system in order to learn how to socialize with people.  Socializing with people in a working environment is a very important thing that usually is not taught in colleges or universities.  This is the first reason why it's very important for college students to have a part-time job.  The second reason is that having a part-time job help students learn the value of money.  Uh, spending time to work somewhere and make money, it lets students know that it takes time and effort in order to save money to buy things rather than to just receive money from your parents or other people to buy things for you.  Financial responsibility and freedom is a very important lesson that is taught by part-time jobs.
Yeah.  I think it's important for students to have a job.  Uh, in western culture, for me, I personally I think that you know they're not always on time.  If they turn up 15 minutes before work, it's way that's just close enough whereas in Japan if you turn up at you know you start at 22:00, you turn up at 43 or 44 past you know that's considered late, which I think is it's – it's a trait I admire.  So, yeah I think it's important for college and university students to have a job, get them prepared for their job in the future, you know, what's the Japanese saying, uh, time is money, uh, and then there is a KidZania thing where children 3 to 15 can work in a – in a job-like environment until they're ready for – for an actual job.
Well, I don't think it's important for university students to have job.  However, I think it's fine that university students have a job, uh, if they need the money or as long as it doesn't interfere with their studies in anyway.  Uh, I can't – I have no objection to university students being employed and I'm sure they could use a bit of pocket money to just spend on whatever.  Yeah, university students having a job is – a part-time job is fine with me.  It may even give them some real life...
I do believe students should have some form of employment during their time in school.  It's better than being given money part [***] away.  I spent time working some jobs while I was in school and generally feel I was better for it.  Generally speaking, I don't feel the students should have to work too many jobs.  Uhm, they track some of their potential to participate in certain other activities, but generally speaking, I think it is very good idea for students to work, uhm, one or a variety of different occupations while  --  while they're going to school.  It's buildup of work experience...
Yeah, is it important for college students to have a part-time job?  Yes, it is.  Having a part-time job prepares you for the workforce even if it is a menial stupid sales job which they usually are working at a pizzeria.  It gets you out of the dorm room, out of the library, out of the study hall, out in the public in a working environment.  Also it shows you that there is a lot of crap jobs out there and that's why you're going to college, so you don't have to work in McDonnell's or a pizzeria for the rest your freaking life.  Also, it gives you a bit of pocket money.  A lot of college kids, they don't have any pocket money, they're fully relying upon their parents.  Having a little bit of extra money in your pocket at the end of the day is always nice when you're in college, it gives you a chance to maybe take your girl out to a movie or you know a cheap dinner or maybe help a friend at the down and out [***] need a couple of extra bucks.
I think it's important for university students to have part-time jobs.  The number one reason is it teaches responsibility to the students.  For example, many students need to learn a balance between having fun and being serious with their studies.  For example, getting good grades, studying hard, and I think having a part-time job is useful because it helps people learn this responsibility.  Another reason is many students go to university and the income from a part-time job is very useful.  So, for these students to have part-time jobs having extra income can be very useful because it relieves the stress of worrying about money.  When you have less stress, it's easier I think and more effective...
Well, I don't know if it's important for students to have a part-time job while going to college.  But, sometimes it's necessary just because, uh, they're working on scholarships or they're working on loans and just having a little bit of extra pocket cash to you know do things, socialize, and eat out or just survive is absolutely necessary.  However, some people are more fortunate where they don't have to do that, you know.  So, uh, you know they're provided for by their families, their savings, and other scholarships that they might have and fortunate enough to get and therefore, they can dedicate more time to their studies and focus on just their education which would be wonderful if everyone can do that.  So, I don't know if it's important for a part-time job.  However, I do believe it's important for them to have an internship so they can field experience while going to college and I think colleges should emphasize that a lot more.
I think it's important for students when they're in school or university to spend as much time concentrating on their studies and doing reading and doing their research as they possible can and so if you have a part-time job, this can often interfere with your – your studying, uh, which is not – not good.  However, if you just do a few hours a week, I think that's – that's not really a problem and can help to give you some more experience of work and of the world outside of school, outside of college.  However, many students like me, for example, don't really have a choice.  You need a job because you need some money.  You need to, you know, pay rent and drink beer and things like that which are important.  So, I had to get a job.  Uhm, when I was a student I had many jobs.  So, I worked in a factory...
I would agree that part-time students should have a job.  Uh, study entails extra expenses above and beyond what most people have to pay anyway, textbooks, tuition fees so on unless someone is independently wealthy or their parents can – can finance their – their studies, most people don't have to have source of income, uh, unless you can get a grant or the – the government way you're studying pays for tuition and, uh, bringing the payments like that.  Study – part-time study is probably preferable to a full-time study.  I tried full-time study – uh, full-time work while I was studying and it was difficult to manage...
I agree that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I think it's important because it will help them earn money and they – that's definitely something they're going to need in the future and probably just to support their, uh – their lifestyle in university and it will also help them balance responsibilities and not only do they have to take care of their university studies, uh, but they also have to juggle I think you have a job and, uh, as they grow older and get out of university, those type of priorities and responsibilities are, you know – are not going to stop just because they leave university it doesn't make things get any easier and usually it tends that things generally get harder...
I think it's important for high school students, even university students, to have a part-time job, but only part time.  I don't think that university students should have a full-time job.  Ah, regardless of their home style at home, I think it's very important that university students have, ah – a – a col - a college part time job working inside the college.  If they're working outside the college, it's maybe more difficult for them.  Ah, working for – for the college is much more convenience because it's much closer inside the college where they can work.  Also, when people work, ah, even part time jobs while they are going to school, they learn basic business ethics.  Also, business ethics is very important for their future.  So, if you really think...
I agree that it's important for college students to have part time jobs, ah, for a couple of reasons.  Number one, it gives them spending money.  We all know that college students don't have much money when they're studying and the obvious reason is that they're studying, most of the time studying.  Uh, one can't be working in the full-time wages.  So, a part-time job allows them to have a little pocket money.  Uh, also, it allows them to juggle their time.  It mostly teach them how to juggle time wisely between their studying and their working which will serve them well after they graduate and get a real job later on in life.  Also, their future employers will look favorably upon someone who has – have had part time job in college.  It shows that they, ah, have a work ethic.  They know how to juggle their time wisely and they know how to take orders, uh, and...
So the question is, uhm, do you think it's important for college students to have a part-time job and do I agree or disagree?  Well, honestly, I think, uh, well, it's case by case because I mean it could be a positive thing, it could be a negative thing.  But I don't think it's mandatory that everybody should have a part-time job.  Uh, I mean if – if that's what you want to do then that's great and you should go and do it and find something you like to do, but I mean, uhm, I don't know maybe some people don't want to work during college.  They want to study or, uhm, give time to their circle or something or – or club or they want to focus on other stuff than working a part-time job then that's great.  I mean, uhm, it depends on the person I think.  It's, uhm, it's not really a generally...
I fundamentally agree that, uh, students in college need part-time jobs.  Uhm, primarily, I guess for the income to assist and then also for the responsibility.  Uhm, most students are young people and they need to, uh, learn how to I guess, uh, become responsible in society and a part-time job is a good way to instill that kind of a responsibility.  So that's definitely one reason but, yeah, it's also important financially as I mentioned earlier primarily due to the fact that, uhm, often scholarships don't cover everything that the – that the student requires to buy for their collegiate experience.  So, yeah, and it's also important for them to save money for their life after college and – and, yeah, in addition to that I guess, uh...
Ah, yes, I believe students in college should have a part-time job and basically, ah, it's – it goes down to responsibility.  Uh, the more they work during school, the more responsibility they have while they're working and learning which will provide them with the necessary backbone to want to work harder to study so that they can get a better job.  By doing that part-time job, they will have to learn what it's like to work as they are studying.  So, they have a deeper respect for the higher positions that they'll have later on in life to their higher education.  Students will learn the value of money as well by working at a part-time job during college times.  Uh, it's very important to understand that money doesn't grow on trees and that money is a very valuable thing to have for your future.  You must save it and you keep it for as long as you possibly can.  By working a job during college, they...
I disagree with the statement.  Um, some people think that it's important for, ah, college students to have a job – a part-time job because they can gain other skills outside of, ah – outside of academic work but although it might sometimes be necessary for college students to have a job because they need the money, um, I think it's more important that college students can concentrate on their education.  So, usually, I think it's better for student to not have a job outside of university.  Um, some students might have a job which is relevant to their, um, their academic work but most part-time jobs the students would be doing, uh, will not be related to what they will do after they – after they graduate university, um, and it will take up a lot of their time and make them very tired um, and this will distract them from...
I disagree with the statement that it's important for college students to have a part-time job while they're in school.  For me, I did not have a part time job in high school or while I was in college because I thought that I would not be able to manage both part-time work and school.  I know many st - many students and friends who did have part-time jobs and I admired that they were able to manage both school and work, but I think that undoubtedly that part-time job cut into their school time and they have less time to work on school things.  So, they would be either very tired or they would just, ah, fall behind in school work.  So...
I think college students should not have part-time jobs so that they may study and have more time to prepare for lessons and exams.  Unless the part time job is a teaching assistant at a university or a paper grader for the university, something that utilizes the skills they've already acquired at the university.  During my time as a college student in the United States, I had to work full-time jobs while going to university.  I felt that this was detrimental to my – detrimental to my university studies.  Um, if I was working 8 hours a day and going to school 8 hours a day, I didn't have enough sleep actually to stay awake in some classes which prompted me to drop out...
Yeah, that's a hard question.  Should college students have - should have a part-time job?  I agree with that.  Maybe college students should have a part-time job because by working, they could learn something besides studying in college and by having a part-time job, you can meet a lot of different kind of people, and by meeting people besides in college, you can – you can learn stuff from them and by talking with them and yeah, that's why I agree.  That's – um, also, you got paid.  That's probably a big reason.  Yeah, you get paid and you get the money and you can use the money or maybe not spend it and just keep it in – keep it for the future.
Ah, my answer is dependent on a particular individual's previous experiences.  Ah, I think if kids have had a part-time job experience in high school, uh, then they don't necessarily need to have part-time jobs in college.  However, for students who haven't, I think it's an important part of, ah, learning.  It's an important life skill to develop.  Um, part time jobs come with different responsibilities and obligations and tasks and skills and things like that than purely academic study does and there isn't really an opportunity afforded to college students in a classroom or in a lecture to learn those particular skills.  Uh, like I said on the other hand though, if a student has already had experience with that, ah, there's really no need for them to develop the skills as they probably already have them and part-time work can interfere with the student's ability to learn academically.
As I have said now for about, about 14 times, um, I don't think it's a matter of um, ah, whether or not you have a part-time job.  It's how the part time job affects your academic performance.  I think it's useful to have a part-time job if you don't [***] ever do it.  A part-time job enables you to get experiences of the real world which you could use when you graduate.  A part-time job gives you real experience with business.  It's maybe useful in a job interview.  They might ask you questions about it and the part time job gives you real experience of business which is useful to certain kinds of exams such as the TOEIC which assumes that you have a real world knowledge of business.  On the other hand, if you spend too much time doing your part time job, it would interfere with your academic work.  You might not be able to complete your assignments.  Ah, you might be late for classes or very tired in the morning.  You might have to miss classes.  So, I think the real question is one of balance.  It's important if you have a part time job that you balance it with your academic work and don't spend all your time just either working or...
I think it's really important for college students to have a part-time job while they're studying at university.  I think so because of three reasons.  It gives students real life skills.  It gives them confidence and it also broadens their social circles and social knowledge.  In terms of giving real life skills, the students are learning how to use cash registers, how to do inventories and how to do things in real life.  I also think that it gives the students a lot of self-confidence.  They are learning to deal with the public but they are learning to use their brain in real life situations to do real life things which also gives them confidence.  It gives them confidence to deal with the public...
I think college students should definitely have a part-time job.  Work experience is a very good thing for college students to gain as they are studying to get to work for their future.  Also, money is a good thing for college students to gain with work experience as a part-time job.  This way, they can have some chance to buy beer from the bars and learn how to socialize and function without asking money from their parents.  This part-time job will give them independence which is also a very good thing.  They will, uh, gain the knowledge of respect for money as they approach their adulthood.  They will survive and build networks as they work and to be honest, it's better if they...
I think it's very important for students, um, of course, to have a part-time job, because students need, uh, money to, you know, sometimes, they want to go out with friends.  So, you know, they shouldn't ask their – their parents to give, lend them some money or you know and they should have money in ca – in case, they want to travel alone, they want to go to some party or want to hang out with friends.  They should have – also have money, because they should be able to stand on their own feet, not otherwise, go to some parents or some family members to let them get some money, um, please lend me money for – for drink or for cinema something.  They should have money for like maybe pay their own things, pay their own bills, like, for like, cell phone – cell phone bill, the apartment bill, maybe they live alone or they – they want to study abroad or anything like this it's really important, you know, like.  It makes, it's good for their education, you know.  They – they – they learn how to – to be in...
I think it's very important for – for the college students to have part-time jobs.  I think it – it shows responsibility if they have it, if they're able to continue on with studies while working at the same time.  It encourages some responsibilities in that they are allowed to – that they have to study, they can manage time much more efficiently and they can dedicate themselves to more than one task at the same time.  Also, I think it's important that the students have enough money.  Most of these students – most college students are living away from home for most of the time and they will need these kinds of, these – this kind of money in order to live and in order to have some kind of fun because for most college students, it is probably the one time in their lives that they are going to be able to have this kind of fun while having, being at a certain age where they can actually have fun as adult – and have fun being treated as adults and also I think the travel is important.  Most college students usually find ways to travel if not while they're at a university...
No, I don't think it's really important to, uh, have a part-time job if you're a college or university student.  Um, if you had all the free time, you'd have more time for studying and doing your assignments.  A lot of students also participate in the university sports and other activities.  So, they might be too busy to have a part-time job.  The – the only exception being that if you did need the money for school as some students do live at the school and have to sleep in the school and stay in the dormitory, that costs a lot of money.  So, if that was the case, you'd probably be better off having a part-time job, uh, although, if – if you don't really have to have a part-time job, it's probably better to...
Yeah, I agree with the statement that students should have part time jobs while they're at college.  The reasons are very many.  One reason is that they will have experiences outside of their university life that they would not normally have just going to school, and they will have an opportunity to understand what it's like to work in the real world while they're going to school.  This is a very important time of their life.  So, it's a great opportunity for them to start to understand the responsibilities that they will have in their future.  It also gives them an opportunity to meet new people and to experience new ideas and it also gives them a chance to work with other people that they would normally never have that opportunity to...
I agree with the statement, because I think that before people leave university, they should get ready for starting a career.  Therefore, they should start with a part-time job so that they can understand the responsibility and understand money for once they leave university and get thrown into a fulltime job.  I also disagree with the – the statement slightly, because I think that students should have time to concentrate on their studies and not worry so much about making money and working, because that's what's going to give them stress in later life, but I do think it's important for students to have some sort of responsibility.  As students, we often think that we don't have responsibility at university.  We just doze through a few lectures and...
Um, I agree with this statement.  Uh, I think during your college days, if you start working, it will help you, um, get ready in life, it will, uh – it will give you a good experience of how your job will be, so maybe just not a job but internship will help.  Um, if you want to get in a job in a company or something, it will help lead you the way, and just to give you an example of how the workforce is after you have finished, um, your – your college days.  So, I think, having a job during your college days is very good, and I think it will be very helpful.  Um, with that said...
I think that I agree that imp – it's important for the college students to have a job while studying.  Um, there are several reasons for this.  I think it's good for students to meet people from outside of their school, and by having a part-time job, they can meet new people from different schools, or maybe older people, and they can learn from the older people.  It's also good because having a part-time job means that college students learn about, uh, economies and how to save money.  By earning money and realizing how much thing costs, students can think about, uh, how they want to spend their money and how much things are worth.  It's, uh, also good for college students to have a part-time job because it will teach them about time management by working...
To answer the topic, I – when we say, it's required or should be required that students have a part-time job in college, we can't agree with that or necessarily disagree with that in my opinion.  You – you definitely learn a considerable amount by having a part-time job if you've never had one before, and this is where culture comes into play.  In the United States, for example, you know, myself and many others high school students at – at the age of 14 and above will start working in high school.  So they already have had part-time work experience by the time they get into college.  So, that's where the culture comes into play.  So, if we come and say that – if we want to make a statement to say that all students in college should have had some kind of work ex...
Well, I believe it's a valuable experience to have a part-time job as a college student.  I don't believe that it is necessary or necessarily important for a college student to have a part-time job.  Certainly, having a part-time job allows, uh, studying – an active student to have a source of expendable income.  Uh, studies are the – the main concentration during – during their time at college, so I don't think that it's necessary for students to have a part-time job if they believe their time is better spent preparing for classes, researching, and creating compositions in order to achieve their degree, especially in a field in which they are interested in.  A part-time job may not even directly relate to the field that they are, uh, pursuing, so.
I believe that college student should have a part-time job.  The main reasons for this are to deal with maturity and preparation for entering the workforce as a college graduate.  Without the experience in the workplace given to college student by having a part time job, I believe that the students, upon graduation, will enter the workforce without necessary maturity having not had the opportunity to make mistakes and experience the dynamics of relationships between managers, co-workers, and customers.  If...
I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job in this day and age, especially for learning a work ethic and learning what is required of someone who has a job especially for after when they finish their university degree and are actually looking for job.  It will serve them well to be able to have gone through the process of searching for work already and having had job interviews and actual experience working with people, so when they're actually into the workforce fulltime after they finish their studies.  It also would help them to learn to budget and save using their own money instead of asking their parents for money whenever they need something new or whenever they need some textbooks and things like that.  It's also imp...
I don't necessarily think that it's important that a college student have – have a job while going to school.  Uh, I mean maybe it will distract from his studies.  Maybe he or she don't need the money.  If they need the money, then sure it's important.  They need money to survive.  They need money for food, for books, etcetera.  Maybe their student loan doesn't give them enough.  Maybe their student line of credit doesn't give them enough.  Maybe their parents don't give them enough.  Maybe their parents are poor.  Maybe, uhm, more than one of those things.  And then at the same it's – it's a good idea to get a job while going to school because you have – I mean you start building up your resume which is important.  The sooner, the better, right?  Well, not necessarily sooner, the better.  But at college, you know, I mean you're an adult – uhm, why not.  Or if the person wants to do it during the summer break or – that's good, too.  I mean it isn't necessarily the case that they have to work while going to college, you know, between, say, September and April in North America or whatever the school year here – is here in Japan.  Uh, I think if they need the money, however, it is a good idea...
I think it's important for students to have a part-time job and while they are studying because the cost of education and the cost of living is rising and if student can support themselves as well as having support from parents and other institutions, then this can only benefit them.  Also, the act of going to a job and the discipline of doing a job also while you're studying is good practice for your working life.  It will teach you how to plan time correctly and also the discipline of completing tasks within a certain time and, uhm, also as a lot of students live away from home these days, if they rely entirely on their parents for their financial support, this can be a huge burden on their pa...
I think that college students can benefit from having a part-time job but not necessarily.  One of the problems is that, uhm, academic considerations can come quite low on the list of – of priorities for some college students and aren't worried that sometimes working a part-time job, uhm, would distract from their main focus which should be to study and to learn more importantly.  On the other hand, I think it can be quite good for students to work because they need to learn, uh, the value of money.  They need to learn how to budget, uhm, and it prepares them for their life doing things which may be they don't necessarily want to do.  They can learn a lot of skills and – but, of course, that does depend on which part-time job they choose.  Uhm, there are some part-time jobs that are better than average and that of which the students who had very interesting and valuable experience from part-time jobs working...
To be honest, I actually, uh – I'd say both, I agree and disagree.  Well, my agreeing point, first of all, would be, well, financially, if students say they gain the opportunity to be working outside and not relying on family income that their parents are making, uh, the students, they – they know the appreciation of money and which would lead on to having them feel the necessity to actually pay attention in class because note the fact of the money that they earn is – even if it actually doesn't go into the tuition, they'd know the appreciation of how much the tuition actually costs and how much their parents are paying for it or it could be the fact of they're getting student loans and that would also kind of let them understand the importance of...
Yes, uhm, I agree that it is very important for university students to have a part-time job.  I believe this, uhm, gives important life skills and it – it also takes them away from study which can be too overwhelming sometimes.  Uhm, so it's also good for time management, uhm, in juggling part-time – part-time job and it teaches them with responsibilities to take ownership of their own life which, uhm, I believe university students do need and plus money skills.  To have your own money to be self-reliant is also very important and – and should be skills that all university students learn and, yes, it feels...
Okay, so the proposed question is do you agree that some people think that the college student should have a part-time job these days?  Personally, I would say, no I don't think it's a necessity.  In fact, I would consider it to be a distraction.  Certainly, work experience is important and college students need it too but I think it can be distracting.  It can be – and it can interfere with studies, and especially if it is a serious student, I don't think really needs to have a part-time job. Now if it's in the summer times or perhaps in the weekends where it doesn't interfere with the studies so much, sure it could be a good idea.  However, I would also see, if you did have a part-time job, it should be something related to the field of study, something that you wanted to – a student wants to do to get some – some hands-on experience.

I believe that college students should have a part-time job where possible because it's very expensive to fund a degree, so these students should be doing something towards their own upkeep.  I also think it will help to keep the students out of trouble.  Perhaps not in Japan but certainly in the UK, students often spend a lot of time going to bars, drinking, and simply partying that I reckon it's really important to cut back on that and spend a little time working, you know, get some work experience and prepare for the world of work.

I think that the question is overly simplistic; you can't universally say that all college students should do something or should not do something.  Really, I think it depends on individual cases.  For some students, having a part-time job is instructive, whereas for others it would be disruptive to the learning process.  I do, however, think that it's sad that so many university students are forced to have part-time jobs because university is as expensive as it is, particularly in western countries.  Really education is a question of the public good and it's an investment of a society in itself and so I believe that it should be free for all individuals.  So, once we hopefully reach that plateau, then the...

My answer to this question would be that it depends.  I think having a part-time job is certainly useful.  It gives the student real-world experience.  This is important for when the student graduates and starts a job, it may be important for job interviews.  it's also important for tests like the TOEIC which assumes a certain real-world knowledge of business, so even as a student having a part-time job could be useful.  On the other hand – oh and by the way, a student also needs money, right, to enjoy themselves because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. On the other hand, if the student spends too much time with his part-time job, the student may not be able to function properly at school.  He may not, for example – sorry, he or she may not be able to complete the assignments.  He or she may be too tired to work hard during – during the day.  Student may be obliged to miss lessons.  All of these things can interfere.  So, I don't think it's a question of its important...

Well, I don't think it's necessarily true that very talented young student should have a part-time job.  I think that talent should be directed towards the things they are talented in.  They are talented, their energies could be wasted in a part-time job that doesn't challenge and sharpen their talent.  So perhaps in a situation like that it would be better for them not to have a part-time job but just concentrate on their studies and the things that they excel in naturally. I believe that they should sharpen and work on their gifts, not squander them in jobs that are beneath them, especially since they have their entire lives to work anyway.  I mean, a 16-year-old does not need to work.  Even though it's quite common for a 13-year-old to go to work, it's not necessary.  I think they should be concentrating on their studies and – and start working later on, maybe when they're done high school and you know, the summer going to...

I agree that it's very important for college students to have a part-time job.  There are several reasons for this.  One of them is that it gives the chance – it gives the students a chance to learn how to deal with people.  They learn how to get along with people, whether they like the people or not, and they are able to learn about themselves and about how to acquire the skills to communicate through that – through the jobs that they have. Another reason is the students learn how to manage their time.  They need to be very diligent to make sure they have enough time to finish their homework and their studies as well as get to work on time and sleep and eat and all of those things. A third reason is it helps the students understand about the world, about society, about how the world around them operates.  They get to see it clearly with their own eyes rather than just learning about it through...

So, the question is do you think it's important for college student to have a part-time job, and do I agree or disagree?  Well, honestly, I think – well it is case by case because I mean it could be a positive thing, it could be a negative thing, but I don't think it's mandatory that everybody should have a part-time job.  I mean if that's what you want to do, then that's great and you should go and do it and find something you like to do.  But I mean – I don't know, maybe some people don't want to work during college, they want to study or give time to their circle or something or – or club or they want to focus on other stuff than working a part-time job and that's great.  I mean, it depends on a person I think.  it's not really a – it can be...

I, on the one hand, while I recognize that, you know, having a part-time job and while, you know, attending college allows students do sort of gain more experience in the workforce.  On the other hand, I think it's also important to recognize that, you know, those just take a significant time burden and that people, you know, students in general should often be focusing more on their studies rather than, you know, in a part-time job that they have just to have a part-time job.  I think it's a matter of what's more important.  I think, you know, having a lot – I think having experience is always great, but in college you're there to learn, you're there to be in college.  You should if you – and unless you have to have a part-time job for financial reasons, you should be focusing on your studies, you shouldn't...

Do I agree or disagree?  Well I don't either.  Basically the issue is part-time jobs for college students.  I think anyone could do part-time jobs or full time if they can handle both whatever they need to do in college and whenever they do at their job.  If they can't handle either, then they should stop doing one of them, and personally, I don't think it's an either/or situation.  I work full time and go to university full time.  I don't think it's an either or, people can, and cannot, so it all depends on who you're talking to.  Yeah.  So anyways that's my answer.  I don't agree or disagree with your question.  It depends on who you are talking to, some people can and some people cannot handle the workload.

I agree that college students should have part-time jobs for two reasons, one, is that college students need to learn valuable life skills outside of school and two, college students should get to do something that they want to do.  From the college students' I've spoken to, they say that one that they really like working part-time jobs so it's important for college students to do something that they like to do, especially after so many years of formal schooling. Secondly, part-time jobs give college students a chance to learn valuable life skills whether it's dealing with people or just scrubbing toilets, college students are able to experience a life that they've never really been able to experience and so that they can learn...

I agree with the statement.  I believe that having a part-time job while being a college student offers a number of benefits to the actual student.  First of all, they are able to gain good experience and learn what the working environment is all about, and at the same time they can lower their financial stress by earning a salary or at least a part-time wage which offers them the ability to take care of financial obligations or to even simply go out and have a good time socially, which leads to the third benefit and that is they are socially engaged while working.  it's not only with customers but also they're engaged with other workers, bosses, and so on.  This offers them a wonderful opportunity to expand their horizons and to simply be engaged.

This is an interesting topic and kind of time for me my daughter is thinking about attending university.  And as a parent, I am the one who are windup putting the bill for most of her expenses.  When I was a student, uh, my parents also tried to support me as much as they could.  But I found that by taking a part-time job, I was able to pay for my own tuition and college life.  And I am hoping that my daughter can also do it.  If I was in a position where I had enough money where I didn't need to support – didn't need my child to take a part-time job, I still think it would be a good way to – to complete their education just studying in a...
Regarding whether a student needs to have a part-time job while they are in university, I don't think it's important that they necessarily have a part-time job.  But unfortunately, I think in many cases, it's necessary for them to have a part-time job to financially support themselves as they go through university.  There are many positives and negatives to having a part-time job in university, but, um, I think university students – student should focus on their studies and many times they are distracted by, um, these part-time jobs or things that might keep them from achieving in university.  But if necessary, part-time jobs can provide opportunities for training if a student is careful in selecting which company or jobs that they apply for.  It can be an opportunity for...
So I think it's really important that college students do part-time jobs, um, and being able to do a part-time job means that you can when you graduate that means you can get a real job.  So part-time jobs are kind of like getting practice and everybody needs practice to get better at something.  Um, maybe, uh, you can, uh, try different jobs to be able to develop new skills and be able to, uh, find something that maybe you have an interest with.  Part-time jobs can give students  --  uh, university college students motivation to try harder.  Um, when a student is motivated, they can do great things.  Another reason -- 
I think it's essential for a college student to have a part-time job.  Um, thinking back of my university years, um, I know that going from high school to university there is a lot more free time in the schedule and students can become quite complacent and lazy if they are not using that free time in productive ways.  Um, and I think what is more productive way than by having a part-time job.  Universities certainly allow us and provide us with detailed knowledge in a specialized field that we hope to pursue in future careers.  But what they don't provide us with is that real workplace experience and – and that's essential for students moving into their future lives.  Um, you know, especially for some students, for example...
I think it's very important for students to have a part-time job while they are going to university.  Some people think that this is going to distract them from studying hard.  However, I believe it can help students to learn the lessons they are learning in class more deeply.  So, however, I think it is important to choose the kind of part-time jobs that are related to the things that you are studying.  I even think it should go further that, uh, the leaders of schools and curriculums should understand that students have to work and they should prepare students, uh, you know, with the, uh, connection to get those kind...
I think it's invaluable for a student to have work experience.  Personally, I work at couple jobs while in university and I believe it helps a person build character.  It helps them understand the concept of budget and it really rounds out their personality.  While I do think, um, it's possible to work too much while in university, I do think it is really, really important for someone have at least some basic work experience while in school.  It's – is just something that really –really I think round up a full college experience and I would recommend it to anyone.  Yeah, I mean I – I worked a lot in school...
I agree that it's good for college students to have a part-time job.  Even though it does take away from their study time and possibly makes them tired, I think it's very useful for them to have work and to have that extra income and to meet people at a very influential time in their lives.  I had part-time work when I was a college student and it was very useful.  I didn't – I don't recall getting money, maybe I did but also I would get school credit for food and other things that was very useful, and I did meet a lot of very interesting people from very different backgrounds from my own.  Uh, so it was very useful and I got a lot of good memories from it too.  Uh, so I think it's very beneficial and that students should have a chance to have a part-time work, especially if it's conveniently located like on campus or something like that.  So...
I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job because it teaches them how to balance the coursework and the demands of the– their time and they have to be organized and they get to experience some work experience as well which is very valuable.  And I think it's important they don't work too hard at a paid job, maybe a part-time job is best, because the most important thing about college is that you study and get your certificates or your degree.  And I – I personally have worked part-time at college and I got a really good experience from it and – and I would recommend that to any students who I know, um, that they should go to – um, go to college and do a– a part-time job.
I disagree with the statement.  I feel that university and college students should not have any part-time job because a student should put all the effort into focusing on studies.  I feel that having a job would take this away for – for example, they would have to be working after university which would affect their study – studying time.  Also, during the many years that people go to university, they have many different reports to write or books to read and this would greatly be hindered by the fact they have to work instead of being all this time on the reports.  When I myself was in university, I didn't have a job and I – therefore, I had more time to write my reports and I feel I could get more – pay more emphasis and more what I guess make people a lot better because I had...
Students today need to be prepared to support themselves while they, uh, become a – while they are students and pay for their own education.  This is important because it – it teaches self-reliance.  It teaches people to become more aware of the actual physical cost of some things that are required in their life, education being one of them.  If they contribute to their education, the education means more.  I had this own – my own experience like this when I was a student.  I was at a rubber tire factory, earn the money in summer and pay for my own tuition, my own books, my own room, and was completely self-reliant without government's help, without help from my parents.  And I had...
The topic of having a part-time job while studying at college, I disagree because it would be a, um, how would you say, uh, a disturbance to their studying.  They wouldn't be able to concentrate on their studies if they have work after school.  So, it will be better for them to not have a part-time job while studying at college.  At college, they can concentrate on studying and getting a better grade.  So when they graduate, they will be able to get a better job and be able to pay off the loans that they had while as a student at a university or college.  So that is why I disagree with, uh, the having a part-time job while being...
I think it depends on the financial situation of the students.  If the students, uh, have enough money, uh, to pay for college and not work a part-time job, it's perfectly acceptable for them to not have a part-time job, so they can focus on their studies.  However, if the student is going into debt or they don't come from a financial situation, uh, where they have plenty of money, then I think it is important to get a part-time job, uh, if only to kind of be on this, you know, be in – in the reality of their financial situation.  Um, I think it creates kind of a – a realness to the idea of student debt, um, so that, uh, you know, a – a student who might be going into student debtor taking out loan in order to finish college can really, uh, start to understand...
I think it's very important for student to have a part-time job while they are working at university or college.  In universities it isn't very cheap and a lot of the time we can't depend on your parents anymore or family members to help you out and the whole point of I think going to college and university is to become an adult and become more independent and understand what the real world is actually like.  And working a part-time job no matter what circumstances it's under or what type of jobs that it is, it's going to give you a bit of a heads off as to what expected of you in the real world once you have graduated and, you know, give you an idea and maybe what you want to look into. Some people are very lucky and can get a part-time job in something they are interested in already, so it can give them a bit more experience and an insight as to what they might be doing in the future.  But, yeah, it's the most developed way when I was...
I'll both agree and disagree with the statement that these days it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  Uh, I agree in the sense that for those students who have the time to get a part-time job and have the inclination to do so that they should be able to.  However, um, for those students who do not have the time, whose study load is too busy, uh, and – and do not have the inclination to – to get a part-time job, I – I don't believe they should be required to.  I think it's important that college students while at university are able to devote themselves completely to the area of study.  I certainly think there are some – uh, some disciplines in – where the workload is so heavy that it would be counterproductive for those students to get a part-time job in order to survive. For example, a medicine ven...
I believe that college student should have part-time jobs because working in the world is an important part of becoming mature.  I think that many college students are overly protected and should have a stronger link with the world of work.  I also think it's important for them to defray their study costs by working for themselves.  When students have everything paid for them, they do not realize the value of their education and this can lead to irregularities in lessons.  It's true that students need to...
Yes, I do believe that university student should have the part-time jobs while they are in school.  So one reason, they need to learn the responsibility of how to spend money correctly, and also by working hard and getting their own money, they realize that money isn't grown on trees for their parents.  Another reason that I believe it's really good for the student is that they – their time is much more structured. Often when a child – when a student is not in working, they have a lot of time on their hands and they ends up partying a lot and they end up doing a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do.  And they also end up not studying the correct way.  I found that study correctly you need to really, um, focus to 20 minutes at a time and work hard and then do something else and then come back and do 20 minutes again.  And therefore, I think that by I am having a job...
I do not think that that question is something that you can easily agree or disagree with because it depends a lot on, uh, how the person views the college experience.  For many people, it's an investment in the future, is gaining, um, skills and the knowledge that will be able to benefit them for their future career.  For others, it's more of a rite of passage, you know, being able to go to an academic institution spending 4 years and then getting a job doing whatever afterwards.  For the people who are looking to invest, they should invest the 100%.  The greater you invest, the more return on investment that you get that is a simple economic principle.  For those who are looking at it in terms of the rite of passage, on the other hand, I think that they really need to figure out what they want to do for those 4 years in their life.  Um, if it is just a rite of passage, if it is just something that people have to go through, then they should spend those years doing what they think is best.  For a lot of people, the work experience...
I agree that college students should, um, get part-time jobs.  One reason why it's because it will be a good preparation for the internships that they will be doing.  For me, I interned for a television company and because I worked at a – um, I have worked part-time at a company before, I was able to, um, talk to my boss the way that I should in a business setting and I was also able to, um, commit myself to the internship – to the internship more.  The other reason why it's good to – for college students to have part-time jobs is because you can learn good commu – you can learn to have good communication skills which will be very important once you graduate and work full-time.  Um, if you work part-time, you would automatically have to report to your boss.
I do think it's important for students to have part-time job because, uh, first of all, they can learn responsibility. While they're university students, it teaches organize many things for them. But when they become part-time workers, they, uh, basically treated as if they are a member of staff by the public, so they have to take responsibility for themselves.  The – the customers, for example, wouldn't differentiate between a student and an – an older adult who is working.  Also, they should, um, take responsibility for their school fees in part.  However, I don't think that students should work too much because their main responsibility is, of course, their study.  So, it's important for students to balance their studies with their part-time job.
I think it can be important for some students to have a part-time job. So, I partly agree with this question.  Um, I think one reason is that students can learn some valuable skills.  Uh, they can meet some different kinds of people, uh, that they normally wouldn't meet, uh, on their campus, uh, so they can meet different kinds of people.  They can learn, uh, about job responsibility and some different job skills.  They can also earn a little bit of money.  So for those reasons it's – it's a good thing for some students.  Uh, but on the other hand, um, not all students should have a part-time job.  I think that it does take up a – a lot of time.  So, uh, if some students have the luxury of not having to do that and focus on their studies, uh, I think it can also be a good thing.  And they can have more free time to – uh, to do their homework to study and also to, uh, spend time with their friends from universities.
I think it's very important for students to focus on their studies while they are at university, and because of this, I don't really agree with the idea of part-time jobs.  So, a lot of people argue that part-time jobs can, uh, give students, uh, important skills that will be, uh, in – increasingly important later in their careers after they finish their studies, but I don't really agree because a lot of these part-time jobs are entry-level which means that anybody can do them and therefore the whole reason of attending university and taking on an advanced field of study is, um, null and void, uh, if one pays more attention to the part-time jobs, as it's often the case, because it does provide a source of income.
I agree with the statement that college students should, uh, work a part-time job while they are studying.  Um, first of all, the reason is because it is good training for you to be able to learn to discipline your time.  When you are busy, you have to have a schedule, you have to live by a schedule in order to get your work done and working also is good training and a good education for life.  And then if you're working, you begin to develop the character that is needed to do a job and to do it well.  Uh, you begin to manage your time and learn how to live each day knowing that you have certain things you must do.  If you're not working a job, then many times you have too much free time and you don't learn to discipline your time...
Do I believe that students should have part-time jobs in university?  Uh, that is a difficult question but I would have say broadly, I would believe yes, there is more to be gained from a part-time job than just economic gain.  Part-time jobs provide real world experience, social structure, how to act as a member of a team and part of a community.  They can also provide other outlook which economic – not economic – educational institutions are unable to provide, how to get along with superiors if you are mistaken.  Uh, also they provide access to the other side of information.  Technically, it's wrong but in this situation it may be the best way to conduct the business.  That is not to say that all part-time jobs are equal, there are lots of...
Despite having been given another 10 seconds to think about this, I still feel that most university students could use a part-time job while they are in college.  It is nice to have some spending money, uh, and like I said before, I mean, you often find that you don't like that first job as much as you thought you might and it is good to find that out in a part-time setting rather than find that out when you are a young person right out of college because if you are in a full-time setting and you have this realization and you quit that job, it looks bad and then it is difficult to find a second job, so better to find that out when you are working part-time and busy doing other things like going to college because most people don't expect that job to last very long anyway, and it is a way of being able to start with one thing and if you change your mind it doesn't look bad like it might in a full-time setting.
I think it is important that college students have a part-time job.  It allows them to find out what is – what work is in the real world and they will be spending much of their future working, so some preliminary job experiences is – is valuable for them when they are seeking full-time employment.  It also allows them to access what working is like, working with other people in a situation where they work for a certain number of hours and are paid for their services.  Working for pay is the basis of society and this – this – this is a great experience for students to come to terms with the real world.  It also allows them after they get a paycheck to try to budget their funds to use it to...
Having part-time jobs for university students is a very important thing.  First, it teaches university students the value of socialization and meeting and working with people in a working setting, which is often not taught in universities.  Second, financial responsibility is a very important outcome from having a part-time job.  Students learn the value of spending time to work, save, and then spend their own money rather than just spending what they receive from their parents.  The third reason why working is such an important thing for students is that it gives them a wide perspective on different vocational chances that they may have to work in the future.  Working in different jobs and seeing what you like the best will help you moving forward to figure out the best way for you to fit into society.  For these reasons, I think that working at a university – working while at university is a very important thing for many students and it's often overlooked by people who think they should just focus on...
Yes, I think it's important for college and university students to have a job.  Uh, by the time they get to the workforce and they finished their – their students and so on, they'll be ready for, if they don't take a gap year they'll be ready for their upcoming job.  For example, in Osaka, you have thing called KidZania, children from 3 to 15 can work in a job until they are 15 to go out into actual workforce, and in Japan, time is money, don't be late, not like you know many English people I work with turn up 10 minutes before their job and that's you know not punctuality.  So, yes I think it's important for college students, they can also save up for their own car, save up for their own travels instead of having to rely on their parents.  Uh, again, many western people I know they are 30 and still live at home because they never learned how to work in actual job.  So, yeah I think it's important.
Yes, well as I said I don't think it's important that students – university students have a part-time job, but there is no reason why they cannot as long as it doesn't interfere with their studies.  Some students may need to have a part-time job for financial reasons, and for some students possibly it can give them some good experience of working conditions in the real world as opposed to the academic world.  So, no I don't think it's important.  However, I don't have any objections to it either.  Uh, so...
I believe students should have a part-time job while in university.  It's good for the students and – and earning their own, uh, spending money.  It's helps with them paying their own bills and it's important if they're going to be working in the future in that they start to develop those habits, uh, necessary to work as soon as possible.  In – in my experience it was a good thing, and I see relatively few downsides to it.  If – if it's possible for a student to work I believe they should.  Of course, there always exceptions or situations where they might not be able to, but generally speaking a student should take advantage of a chance to work when they can.  It's...
Is it important for a college students to have a part-time job?  Probably not.  I mean the kids who have part-time jobs in college are the ones who don't have rich parents.  The ones that have rich parents don't need part-time jobs and they might well use that extra time studying.  I mean when I was in college I worked two jobs not because that I working and going to college was cool or fun because I freaking I had to, I had no money.  It's the only way I could pay my tuition.  Do I wish I didn't have to work?  Yeah.  But, at the same time I'm glad I had little extra money in pocket and I made a lot of social connections through those jobs.  And when I got out of college, I had a handful of people ready to give me a job, why because I met them through working.  I already established a good working ethic and I had shown it and proven it to other people in the working community around me so they were eager to hire me.  So, yeah it was kind of nice effect when I left college I had lot of people that knew who I was and what a good worker I was.  Uh, but then at the same time man I wish I didn't have to work, ‘dI much rather hang out drink beer and...
I think it's important for university students to have part-time jobs.  It's definitely useful.  Many students go to university and have stress over money issues most likely due to a lack of money.  Having a part-time job can help relieve the stress of these money problems.  But more importantly, I think having a part-time job can teach students responsibility, time management.  So, these are important issues for university students to learn because these are skills that can easily transfer to life after school when you start your first job, for example, time management and having a proper balance between work and fun is very important I think for everyone to learn.  I had many part-time jobs when I was a university student.
Jeez, I think I summed it up pretty well the first time.  But, let me focus more on the importance of internships compared to part-time jobs.  I –I think it's more important for students going to university to get field experience in the field of their study rather than actually, uh, dedicate their time to, uh, earning pocket cash.  So, it'll be nice if everyone could be able to have enough money to support their college lifestyle and just focus more on their education, but that's not always the case and they would have to get a part-time job.  Two, uhm, yeah, I think you should go back and listen to my first example, so I was able to sum it up a little bit more clearly.  But I think you got the point.  Anyway, it was very nice talking to you and I guess I'll move on to the question two, 60 seconds haven't passed yet.  Okay, anyway, uhm, yeah that's it from me.  Internships let's go, I wish I had one.  I didn't do it.  But anyway, I'm doing pretty good for myself at the moment.  Uh, I think I'm talking to you...
Well, as I was saying about 30 seconds ago I think it's fairly important for students to have a part-time job, especially students who come from working class background or you know low middle class background because it helps them get some money, helps them to join in, you know, with the social life at school and go to the pub and things like that.  Uh, when I was a student as I was saying I used to work in a factory, I used to work in some stupid shop that sold school uniforms.  I worked in an office you know on Facebook all day.  Uhm, I used to work in a bar, it was pretty good, you get free drinks and talk to people and things like that.  It was pretty good.  But, because of my jobs I suspect I didn't do so well when it came to my exams.  I didn't put as much effort into class work and what have you, and so my scores at school were pretty rubbish.
I would agree that students have to – should have a part-time job, uh, that e – entails expenses above and beyond what most people have to pay anyway. So unless someone is, uh, independently wealthy or supported by the parents, it would be necessary to – to have a part-time job, pay for the tuition and textbooks as well as the – the usual expenses that most people have to pay anyway.  Uhm, part-time – part-time work is probably preferable to full-time work.  Uh, full-time work just is – entails too much of workload for someone who is already studying.  So, part-time is probably better – better compromise between a high-income and enough time to – for study, uh.
So, yeah, it doesn't always make things harder, but, uhm, when you leave university, you just start having more things to do.  So, to come back to having a part-time job and working at the school, again it's important.  Um, another thing that having a job does is, uh, it opens you up to new experiences.  If, uh, student is working on something, they may be introduced to something that they didn't realize that they liked and maybe that gives them an opportunity to ex – to try new things and be part of something that they hadn't considered before.  Uh, another good reason is that they can learn some personal responsibility, uh, having a job and going to school...
I think it's very important for students who are going to university to actually try to get some work or find some work, ah, preferably in the – in the school, within the school area.  Also, I think that when students work especially when they're at – when – while they are – they are attending school, they can actually learn basic business ethics and I think everyone in the future can use business ethics and this will help them not only with the subject that they are learning, but ah, if anything goes wrong, they can actually use their business ethics, ah, while they – while they are working.  So, I think it's very important for people to – uh, students also to, uh, to go to school while they are attending a university so they can also support themselves with their own money, uh, along with other different scholarships because all money is good...
Yes, as I was saying, ah, I do believe that, ah, it is a good idea for college students to have part-time jobs, ah, while they're studying because as I said, it gives them pocket money.  Uh, also, it's – it, ah, teaches them how to juggle their time effectively between their studies and their work um, and um, their social life as well and also, it's ah, it gives them experience working, you know.  Uh, it's a precursor to working in the – in the real world, you know, after college, after graduation, uh, and so – and – and employers look preferably upon students who have had part-time work while studying.  It shows that they have, ah, initiative, ambition, ah discipline and work ethic.  They know how to take orders and ah, they know how to juggle their time.  They know how to, you know, juggle fast.
Okay.  We're at round two and here we go, uh, talking about college students and whether they should have part-time job or not.  Uh, as I stated before, I think it's – it depends on the situation.  I mean some students – I mean may enjoy it and it may help their life and then be great for them, but whether it's great for all students, that is questionable.  Uhm, I mean maybe student want to focus on other things besides working.  I mean, uhm, they want to do their hobby or study harder or, uhm, I don't know, spend time doing their activities or whatever, that's fine.  Uhm, and that means if they want to make money then they want to get experience or whatever or, yeah, then working a part-time job is great.  I mean I'm all for it.  Well, if you're not for it then I'm all for that too.  I mean it's...
As I said earlier, I fundamentally agree that the students at – college students should have part-time jobs.  Uh, it's necessary in today's society.  Uhm, actually, it always has been to be honest.  Uhm, they definitely need these part-time jobs.  It's an important role in college to teach them these responsibilities.  Uhm, they also need to support financially.  We know that.  We're aware of that.  Let's just hope that they continue to do that, uhm, and it's – it assisted me through college.  I remember when I was a student back at [***] that was fun times and, yeah, basically I needed a part-time job to get through and I think college students today certainly need those jobs as well.  So, uh, I would encourage people to continue having these jobs that are important and let's hope that colleges everywhere allow the students to have these part-time jobs.  I know in some countries that it's actually illegal for them to have part-time jobs while they're at college which can be [***] problematic given the situa...
Yes, college students should have a part-time job while they're working.  Students should learn, uh, the value of money through hard work and should learn responsibilities from working so hard.  They should learn to value their time, uh, as well as how to manage themselves and their money more effectively.  They should also learn about networking through, uh, working a job.  Maybe they can network for future, uh, possibilities of, uh, future employment.  Further, they – the value of, of that networking could lead to long lasting friendships that would lead to something far more valuable than money itself.  Students should also learn time management, how to keep their schedules intact and how to hold responsible – uh, their own opinions and their own ideas through that hard work.  Um, sometimes students feel that, that there's a gap between what they are learning and how to work in the working sit- situations.  So, by working, they come to apply some of the ideas that they are learning in the classroom to make it a...
I disagree with the statement.  I don't think that college students should usually have a job outside of their academic work.  Um, having a part-time job will distract students and also make them very tired or make it more difficult for them to concentrate on their studies.  Although some students might need to have a job if they don't have enough money, um, as far as possible, I think the students should not have a part-time job outside of their work.  Most of the part-time jobs that students will be doing um, will not be relevant at all to their future careers and will not be relevant at all to their – to their academic work. um, to what they're studying at the time.  Um, I also think that um, um, ah – I also think that, um, having a job will make the students very tired.  I've seen lots of students who are unable to focus on their academic work because um, they've been working too hard.  So, although, sometimes it's necessary for students to have jobs, um, it would...
I disagree with the statement that students should have a part-time job during university or college.  I did not have a part-time job during high school or college because I thought that I would not be able to manage both part-time work while in school and I think many students believe the same as me.  Um, though, however, students who did have part-time jobs and managed work or managed school work at the same time, I admire them and those students who come out of that event successfully develop good management skills.  However, I don't think that students should be forced to have part time jobs unless they have no choice and they need money for school.  Um, ah, I guess, that's all I have to say about that.
Okay, as a university student, I think it's very difficult to work and study at the same time unless you're working as a teaching assistant or a paper grader for the university in the area of which you're studying so that the areas that you've studied in are – are, um, useful in your work and the work you're doing will help you review some of the things you've learned in the past.  That way, you're furthering your – you're getting some extra money and you're furthering your education by being a paper grader or a teaching assistant.  I also think that if you're working as a – as a guard and you're just sitting at a box, you may use that time to study, but I think it cuts into your time to sleep and socialize with peers, so you can't...
Yeah, it's the same question, but I agree and I also had a part-time job when I was in college and it was really fun.  It was – you got to learn stuff and got to – actually, I worked at a hamburger shop and I got to see what we usually don't be able to see like outside, not outside but inside the hamburger shop and it was – it was a good time.  It was a – yeah, so maybe not all, but like college students should have part-time job and by having a part-time job, you can see a lot – a lot of things besides just studying in class – in the classroom and just taking notes and all that.  So, um, whatever...
Ah, I think it's – well, I think it's important for all students to have some life skills, ah, I think the question of whether or not they should have a part-time job in college is dependent on previous experiences.  Um, if students have already developed the life skills that come along with having a part-time job, maybe while they were in high school or during the summer or something like that, then no, I don't think, ah, students should take a part-time job while in school.  However, if they never had that kind of experience, I think either a part time or something similar, um, would be very useful.  There are certain ah, skills that one can acquire when working a part-time job that they couldn't in a classroom or a lecture setting.  Ah, there are certain responsibilities and obligations, ah, that are asked to them when in those situations.  Um, I think too many students devote too higher portion of their time to learning and...
As I said, I think um, it's not a matter of, ah, whether or not you have a part time job but it's a matter that if you do have a part-time job, it should be balanced with your academic performance.  Um, on one hand, the part-time job could be useful.  Obviously, you need money.  If you're a student, you need to, to enjoy yourself or work [***].  Also, it's useful to have real world experience so when you graduate, you get a job.  It's useful that the real world experience at working that you actually talk about in a job interview, they might ask you about that and it's useful to have real world experience of work as a basis for some exams, such as the TOEIC exam even as a student because that is assumed a level of – a knowledge of the business but you otherwise you wouldn't have as a student.  On the other hand, if you are spending too much time in your part-time job, you won't be able to keep up with your academic work.  You wouldn't be able to complete your assignments or you might be late for classes or you might be too tired to participate or you might miss classes.  So, I think it's – it's useful to have a part-time job but you mustn't overdo it.  As we...
I believe that it's important for college students to have a part-time job while studying in a college, because it gives them confidence, real life skills, broadens their social circles and social knowledge.  When they work, in a work situation, they're meeting more people, they're learning how to deal with people professionally, deal with colleagues and also deal with the public.  They are learning to deal with – use real life skills as in using a register, talking with people, talking with customers.  They're also learning, Keigo, polite Japanese, also learning specific kinds of language to use when dealing with customers.  It gives them confidence as they have self-worth about – they're earning their own money which also increases their self-confidence.  They're learning to deal with a variety of people which will also increase their self-confidence that...
Part-time work is a very good thing indeed for university students, college students, and the like.  It gives them work experience before they actually find a fulltime job and have to work every single day.  It will blend in the shock from only study to fulltime work.  It will gradually introduce them to the real life.  Uh, it will give them money as well which is a good thing that I said earlier to be able to buy things and mix in society, go shopping and go restaurant dining, wining, and independence as well so they don't have to depend on their parents.  So, they – they will be able to make their own decisions as they approach adulthood.  It gives them these survival skills which are very necessary, and I wanted to mention that if they have a part-time job in their field of study, that's an excellent foot in the door when they...
Yeah, of course, it is important for students to do a part-time job.  Um, they should learn how to stand on their own feet, um, how to earn money, so, um, how to use their money in a good way, how to stay in the future abroad if they want to live alone in their own apartment maybe.  Um, also, like, you know, the universities are not cheap.  If they want to hang on with friends, go to some party, go to the cinema, maybe they have a girlfriend, so they need to support them.  You know, not just always ask their parents, hey, lend me some money, because I want to do something, should do a part-time job, because so, they have money to, um, buy the stuff they want, they need, and yeah, of course, it's, um, – they, maybe one day, this, they are – they'll learn how to integrate in the, you know, in a work, in a business and – one day, when they finish studying, when they graduate, they know how to work and how it is to work and like not only one day or more.  It is good for their...
Yes, I think it's important that college students should have part-time jobs in order to further their world view, because I believe that part-time, the part-time work as a – a college student usually ends up leading towards travel and to broadening of experiences within life.  Most college students have no idea what happens in life before entering college and after entering college of what happens.  They've been studying for the past over 12, 15 years.  So, having a part-time job is obviously a very good idea.  I think having a part-time job is very good, because with this money they can have many different experiences and hope, they become much, much more useful in life later and I think, as I mentioned earlier that travel is a wonderful thing and that because of part-time – part-time work, this becomes very - very important and also, I think part-time work is very important, because students are – no need to tell these things, but students should have part-time work, because...
No, I don't think you really need to have a part-time job if you're a university student.  Um, you can spend more time on your studies and try to get better grades.  Um, a lot of college students these days participate in many different activities.  Some are on sports scholarships.  So, they don't really have much time for a part-time job.  Uh, with the free time that you could have instead of working, uh, you could do more research, uh, get involved in your classes, uh, participate with other students and other projects, um, but if you are in a situation where you are probably staying at the school dormitory that might cost some money, uh, so you'd probably be better off having a part-time job.  Um, part-time jobs can give you a little extra money, but if you're supported by...
Yeah, once again I agree that students should have an opportunity to work outside, part time while they're at the university.  The reasons are very many.  One reason I think that they should is that they have an opportunity to meet new people, to experience new opportunities that they would normally never have.  While they were at university, they're not tied down to this that lifestyle of going to school every day, but they will have an opportunity to experience work and then, learn about things that they would not normally do.  They will have an opportunity to understand when they will become, be like for them when they get further along in their life and they'll understand that to have the responsibilities of going to work and going to school, carrying up...
I think it is important for students to have part-time jobs, because it gives them a sense of responsibility which they will have once they leave university and it also helps them to understand and learn about money.  Once they leave university, they'll be starting into fulltime work.  So, this is a little bit of preparation for them.  It would also help them decide what they want to be and what they want to do with their future.  I do, however, think that they should still have time to concentrate on their studies and not worry too much about a job.  Therefore, part-time work is a good idea, but it should be flexible and I think minimal hours, just enough for them to learn some responsibility and earn the money that they will need to pay back once their studies are over.  I think that is also important that...
Okay.  So what's my previous answer, I do agree with this statement.  Um, and going along with the internships and getting you ready for life after college, um, I think it helps you get into a routine.  It helps you set, um, schedule, and um, it then helps you manage time.  So, I think it's a very good thing, um, and plus it gets – it gets students money.  So, during college, you – a lot of us or many of us, um, don't very or don't have a lot of money, so may be a job is even necessary even if we didn't really want the experience, you might need it for the money.  So, having a job gives you a lot of options, and – and it helps you with just moving on ahead.
So, as I was saying, it's important for time management, and if students are busy working at their part time job on the weekend, then they will have less time to study for school.  So, it's important for them to realize how to work in a quick and efficient manner.  Um, and they will also learn new skills like, uh, if they work in a shop, then they will learn about dealing with money and with customers.  It's really important to know how to deal with customers, because it means your communication skills will improve, and most jobs deal with customer in some way or another, whether it's teaching where your customers are your students, working in a hospital where your customer are the patients, etcetera.  So, by gaining good customer service skills from the young age, students will have an advantage and they won't just be focused on their school work.
Okay.  When we say that work experience should be required for college students, that they should have a part time job while in college.  Well, we have to consider the cultural implications that come along with that to what we're trying to accomplish by having that work experience.  For example, in the United States, students will, you know, will have had – most of us will have had some kind of part-time job work experience before we even get to the college, and many of us will continue part-time employment while we are in college.  In other countries, that's more of a rarity.  China, for example, it's very rare, very, very rare for a student prior the college or even in college to have any work experience.  Now, I do agree that they get a lot of value; there a lot of skills and benefits of having part-time work while they are in college.
I believe it is a valuable experience for a college student to have a part-time job.  I do not agree that it is necessary or even necessarily important for a college student to have a part-time job.  The reasons are that, well, there are many advantages to having one's own expendable income.  Part-time job is not necessarily affiliated with the subject that they are pursuing in their academic institution, so it may not contribute to their main area of study, which they should be spending more time in during a critical period of study such as, uh, time at a – at a college or university.  If it does not contribute to their future, then it is not the best expenditure of their time.  However, if it's in their field, I would say, it would be a valuable way.  An internship would be much more appropriate in my opinion.
I believe it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  The reasons for this are mainly due to the level of maturity which students must gain before entering the professional workplace as a college graduate.  Without this maturity, which I believe can only be gained by experience in the workplace, students will be only marginally more mature than should they have entered a professional occupation without any, um, further education.  The students who obtain part-time jobs get very good experience dealing with manager...
Important for university students to have a part-time job while they are studying?  I think it serves them well to learn what it is like to go through the process of going through job interviews and also working with people in the workforce part-time to prepare them for the future when they have to actually go through in the interview process of full-time jobs which are much more important for their future as all – and also to have experience what it is like to have a job and to – also it's good for them to learn to budget and save their own money as opposed to being a burden on their parents or being a burden on their government taking benefits for students and especially for students who have to move in to the city from regional areas, it's very important for them...
I don't necessarily think it's a bad idea that college students work while going to school, but if they have enough money to survive, uh, maybe because they have enough money saved up or their parents give them enough money or they have a really big student grant or loan then I don't think, you know, they necessarily should work while – while studying because it will distract from their studies, they might not get uhm – ah, the marks they would have gotten if they just concentrated on studying rather than dividing themselves between work and school which can be exhausting.  And, ah, you know, that being said, however, I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea either to work while going to school.  You start building up your resume, you get some extra money in your pocket, maybe your parents are poor, maybe a – the student isn't getting enough money in student grants or student loans.  So, yeah, why not?  I mean either way, it should be up to the person.  They shouldn't be forced into it either way, but I mean definitely, if the person comes from a poor background and they don't have enough money, they should definitely work while...
For students to have a part-time job while they study is – is very important I think.  For them to be financially somewhat independent is a good skill to learn for the future.  And also it's going to relieve the burden on their family who are no doubt supporting them financially while they study.  As a lot of students can study away from home, particularly in the UK, then they need money for not only accommodation but food, entertainment, and any other hobbies that they might want to pursue.  Also, for their general entertainment and also study materials they might need money.  So if they're doing a job, they – they can help provide for themselves and this is a useful skill for when they go out into the working world.  They'll also be given a certain amount of – learn a certain amount of disciple.
There are various pros and cons for college students having part-time jobs.  Uhm, on the downside, a lot of students already have difficulties prioritizing and organizing their lives and, personally, I think that the priority for college students should be to learn and to make the most of the opportunities for education that they have to find out more about the world and having a part-time job can distract from that considerably.  However, having the part-time job can also be a learning experience in itself.  Uhm, students can learn how to manage money, how to organize their lives, and how to work with other people.  So for that reason, probably on balance, I would say, a part-time job is a good thing for most college students, uhm, as long as they choose their part-time job carefully and do something which is worthwhile, uhm, and I think it can be a good thing for them in that situation.  Uhm...
I agree with this statement because if students they get to work part time, they'd learn the appreciation and the – the struggle of how hard it is to earn money these days and that would lead on to appreciation towards their family as well as appreciation to be able to have the opportunity to be able to study because not many students – well, this is globally thinking, only it's really hard for other people like such – as people in, uh, the Middle East to receive the best education.  So I believe it's really good for them to learn how studying and earning money is important.  And I also could disagree because of – if they're taking time to earn money that means it cuts back the time for them to study at home.  So if – if they're being a full-time student, not...
Yes, I believe it is very important for university students to have a part-time job.  Uh, it teaches them such great life skills that they need for, uh, going forward as well as time management, juggling part-time job and university studies.  Uhm, it also teaches them about, uhm, handling their own money, their own finances so they're not reliant on others to get them through life.  And it's also a great place to be introduced to other people and other attitudes and it gives them skills that will help them when they do eventually into the workforce.  Part-time jobs also really beneficial, uhm, takes them away from studies and put them in a different frame of mind which I believe the university st – students desperately need to get away...
Okay, so I do not necessarily agree with the opinion that college students should have a part-time job mainly because I think it can be quite distracting.  I think college itself is a full time job.  I can understand some people's reasoning, perhaps they think it builds character, teaches them responsibility, time management, things like that, which can be good.  But study has got to be the main focus for university students.  Now, an internship or something like that, on the other hand, could be quite valuable.  But then again, I would it in summer times when the student didn't have studies.  And I base this mainly on my own experience.  You know, I struggled – I had to – I had a part-time job just to help pay for college and at times it could really get in the way, especially in the last semester I really struggled with that.  It wasn't very easy to manage both, a job and school.  So, yeah I don't necessarily...

Yes, I believe that college students should get a part-time job because college is very expensive.  They should pay towards their own costs.  Also, it will cut back on the time that they spend drinking and partying.  A lot of people seem to think that university is one long party and then when it's time to get a job, they are completely at loss.  I think they need a part-time to bridge from university to the world of work.  Of course, when it gets just a little bit later, there's more pressure up, perhaps they are about to graduate, they need to write the dissertation, they should be able to kick back a little. I believe in funding for higher education as well.  I believe they should get a grant if they are prepared to work part...

I don't think students should ever have to have a part-time job in order to pay for their education because education should be free, in that it's a public good that should be available for us – for all citizens.  But if they wanted to have one, for some students it might help them learn things, things like particularly apprenticeships may help them learn useful skills that could be beneficial for them moving forward into their careers – their postgraduate careers. The problem that I see is that university at this point is expensive as it is.  You know, we have students graduating who have, you know, hundreds and thousands – hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of debt and then there – they live so much of their lives as indentured servants trying to pay off the time they spend in university.  And I don't think that that is a good reason why they should have to do part-time jobs, you know.  The part-time job should be something that they engage in, in order to better themselves rather than to try to pay off the debt that they are in...

As I said before, I think it's useful for students to have a part-time job.  After all, they need money.  All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.  it's useful real-world experience for when they graduate.  It may be useful in preparing them for job interviews where they may be asked questions about whether or not they have any experience of actual work.  It involves responsibilities, for example, and it may be useful to them as a student because if they are taking a test like the TOEIC, they will be required to show a certain real-world knowledge of business, which they probably wouldn't have without a job. On the other hand, I think it's important that they don't spend too much time doing their part-time job because it will interfere with their school work.  They will not be able to complete all those assignments.  They may miss some classes.  They may be very tired and unable to perform properly.  So, I think the important thing is not whether you have a part-time job or not, but that the part-time job is balanced against the rest of your academic life.  That's the most important thing.

I think it's okay for a young person to go to work no matter how talented or untalented they are.  There's nothing wrong with having some extra money in your pocket, but I don't think it's necessary, especially if the job squanders their energies, which can be directed towards sharpening and bettering themselves and their talents and their skills.  Perhaps, the world would benefit from them only concentrating on the things that they excel in, so that they can get better and better at those and then maybe even be able to make a living from those things in the future and maybe that's where their studies will be concentrated on in university, maybe even after that in graduate school. ...they'll be able to improve themselves, improvement of their talents instead of squandering it on things that are possibly beneath them, you know, in a part-time job that most people...

I agree that it's important for college students to have a part-time job because it gives them a chance to learn how to deal with people and to communicate, to get along with people.  It also gives them a very clear way to learn how to manage their time.  They need to be very diligent to get to work on time, to work, and to also complete their studies, do their homework within the time restraints that they have. Having a part-time job helps people understand the world and how society runs.  And the fourth reason is because it gives people – it give students a more clear reason.  It helps them decide more clearly what exactly they want to study and what exactly they want to do in their future.  Without having a part-time job, it will be difficult to know if what they're studying is actually what they...

Okay we are round 2 and here we go, talking about college students and whether they should have a part-time job or not.  As I stated before, I think it's – depends on the situation.  I mean, some students, I mean, may enjoy it and may help their life and be great for them but whether it's great for all students, that is questionable.  I mean, maybe students want to focus on other things besides working, I mean, they want to do their hobby or study harder or, I don't know, spend time doing their activities or whatever.  That's fine, and – I mean if they wanna make money then they wanna get experience or whatever or – yeah then working a part-time job is great.  I mean I'm all for it.  Well if you're not for it, then I'm all for that too.  I mean it's...

On the one hand, some people will often argue that, you know, having a part-time job while in college teaches gives, you know, it's better “time management skills”, gives you, you know, I guess a little more experience in the workforce, some valuable experience generally.  But on the other hand, I feel that, you know, when you are in college, that is your job.  You know, university is a job, learning a college – at a college level is a job.  You are there to learn.  Unless you have to have a part-time job because of financial reason, I don't necessarily think it's better to have a part-time job because it will distract you from [***] not necessarily mean that you have less time to think and do your study.  And, you know, on that subject, I think, you know, I think that's important and I think dedicating yourself entirely for [***] you know it's a job.  You are there to do it, so you know you should be...

Part-time jobs – I think some people should do part-time jobs.  I think part-time jobs are an interesting thing to do.  You can get money doing a part-time job and you can do interesting job experiences.  But at the same time, people shouldn't do part-time job if they can't handle the workload.  There are way too many kids at Temple University especially that seem to have part-time jobs and cannot handle the workload issued to them by Temple University. So those students, they should either quit Temple University and go work full time or quit their part-time job.  But at the same time, there are people that do part-time jobs at the same time as going to university.  Those people should continue to do their part-time jobs.  So this question whether I disagree or agree with your proposition that part-time jobs are useful or should people do part-time jobs while going to university, is a difficult question to answer with a yes or a no.  I...

I agree with the statement that college students should have part-time jobs for two reasons.  One, I think that college students need to learn valuable life skills outside of school; and two, I think college students should be able to do something that they would like to do during college.  it's pretty clear that college students learn a lot of valuable skills in schooling but they don't learn a lot of things that common people do, such as such scrubbing toilets or just talking to people outside of the home or their clubs in school. Secondly, I think part-time jobs give college students a chance to do something they want to do.  Talking to college students that I know, they really like working their part-time jobs, so I think it brings joy to their everyday life and it's something that they can look forward to, to relieve their stress or to just make a little money on the side away from mom and dad.  Furthermore, buka buka buka, and you know what I'm saying and about.

Yes I agree with the statement that students should have a part-time job.  I believe this simply because it's an opportunity to gain great experience in the workplace which they can then carry on after their college experience and find it easier to find a job.  As well, it will lower their financial stress, being able to take care of their financial obligations as well as having some extra spending money. The final point that we made here is that they are more able to be socially engaged while having a part-time job, not only with customers but also with co-workers, bosses, and society in general.  This offers them a wonderful experience with expenses – excuse me, experience, financial stress, and being socially engaged.  Yes, students should have a part-time job while they are in college.

I think – I think a part-time job is important for higher education, but not necessary.  Uh, a college and university is a place where you go to study and there's a – a large enough workflow that can take up most of your time and effort and sometimes a part-time job will distract from your ability to focus your – your attention or work on papers.  Um, that being said, having extra spending money and learning how to, uh, get along with other people in a situation, uh, at – at work or – or, uh, handling – handing money and cash and – and dealing with public in – in a workplace is – is also important aspect of getting along in life.  You learn to budget your funds.  You learn to take care of money, look after bank account.  And these are all very...
Regarding the question whether a student should have a part-time job or not, uh, I think unfortunately many times, uh, it's necessary for a student to have a part-time job in order to support themselves financially in university.  There are some pros and cons to having a part-time job.  Uh, one negative is that, um, students might not be able to focus as they should on their studies at hand.  But on the other hand, if it's necessary, it can provide an opportunity for them to begin working in the field that they wish to – uh, in – in the field that they are pursuing, uh, and provide them with the necessary experience so that when they graduate from university they have some experience and are able to go ahead and count that on their resume as they apply for, um, a position – a long-term position in their field.  So, I think, um...
Okay.  So having a part-time job for college students is really important because it gives them real-world experience.  Everyone that goes out into the real world, they need this real-world experience and so, um, having, uh, doing a part-time job gives a student this and it's really important because not only will it help you get real-world skills, it also will help you to develop yourself.  So maybe you, uh, are able to do some things, but a part-time job forces you to do actions and things that maybe you are not necessarily good at but it helps to develop these skills, such as working at a restaurant, uh, communicating with customers, uh, being able to understand what somebody else is thinking, um, also being able to work at part-time jobs gives you, uh, some...
Yeah, in my opinion college student should definitely have part-time jobs.  I'm speaking from my own experience going to, um, a single-sex high school, um, and then moving into my college life which was predominantly a male-based, um, course.  Um, we didn't have the opportunity to develop a working relationship so strongly with people of the opposite sex.  Um, an – and I think that that is essential for anyone moving into a – a career after college life.  So definitely, you know, one of the advantages of the part-time job is that it provides us with those experiences working with people of the other sex, but not only that also learning how to work as a member of a team in a workplace following the rules of an employer.  Um, an – and also learning the value and the meaning of earning money for ourselves.
Students when they come to class, they actually only spend about 1 hour or 2 hours in class out of a – a whole day which, you know, so I think students – teachers have to know that the longer students are spending studying, the more they will retain the knowledge.  So since a job requires so much time, uh, teachers can have their students do well if they use the part-time job to be extra studying of the lessons and stud – teachers shouldn't be judged.  They should be judged based on how well their students do.  So, if your students do really well, then the teacher should get credit for that.  So, it should be in teacher's best interest to promote that kind...
I believe it's important for students to have at least a part-time job while working – while attending university.  It is important to round up the person's character.  It's important for a person to understand fully what, uh, what it means to actually earn money, budget money and deal with the – balancing the both individual schedule.  Um, my own experience is true worthwhile and I really recommend it to anyone.  That's really about I have to say about, um, yeah.
Even though part-time work for students in theory takes away from their time to study and rest, I think having part-time jobs while being student is a great thing.  Uh, it allows them to get some extra money at a time when they are probably very poor in their lives.  Uh, also they can get if they work on campus, they can get some kind of a credit at, let's say, restaurants or maybe school stores or things like that.  Uh, especially if it's on campus, it's very convenient.  There's hardly any commute time or gas, or driving, or those kinds of expenses.  So, I think it's fantastic and you get to meet the other people at a very influential time, uh, in their lives.  So that was my experience when I was in college having a part-time job, even though it wasn't, you know, a career or anything, it was a really a great experience and I have fond memories of it and it was very useful.  So, I had...
It's important for college students to have a part-time job because it teaches them many things.  It teaches them responsibility.  It teaches them to be organized and it teaches them about the world of work and about the importance of – of working.  It's important that they don't work too hard because their study should be the most important thing about going to college, so maybe part-time work is better than full-time work.  I have experienced part-time work and studying myself and I recommend that to other people.  And I think it's also good to work in an area that's rele – um, that's relevant to your studies.  So, if you are studying medicine, you could work in the care home or something like that to get good experience and to apply what you learned at college to everyday work.  Um, students can...
I disagree that students should have a part-time job when in university and college.  I feel that having a full-time or even part-time position will add – cause – would really hinder their studying and affect their outcome and scores.  If people have jobs, they will spend a lot of time working and not studying which is more important at – at that time.  Also, after they finish work, they will not have the appropriate amount of time to study after work.  Most of the times when people work, they are tired after work so they will not have the opportunity to study more.  Having no job would allow them to study from the moment they get home from college or university to the moment they go to bed.  Also, they include the weekends which would be more important because they have this whole day and no classes to study for.  When they have the fourth [***] year, it's very important that they spend a lot of time...
Students need to be prepared to work part-time to support themselves while they are in school.  Uh, if there is a long summer break like in the United States, they can have a full-time job for 2 or 3 months and earn some fair enough money to make a significant contribution to the cost of their education.  In Japan where schools are more year around [***], the student can hold the job like in a, uh, restaurant or in a convenient store and earn money on the side that pays for the incidents that are from day to day and parents and government supports and scholarships can fill in the rest.  But if the students making their own contributions, then they feel like their education is something they invested themselves and time and money and, uh, their own efforts.  This makes it, uh...
Uh, the topic of part-time job while at a stud  --  being a student at college or university, I disagree with this point because it would be a distraction or disruption to their studies.  So while they are at university or at college, they are studying hard to get a degree.  So if they have a part-time job, it would disrupt their studies.  They would not be able to concentrate on getting a better grade and therefore not be able to graduate from that college.  Therefore, I believe that they should not have their part-time job while studying at college or universities.  So then they would be able to study harder and concentrate on their studies and be able to graduate and get a better job.  Once, they have graduated and pay off their loans for the university or college that they have -- 
Um, in terms of whether or not having a part-time job during college is important.  Um, I think that it completely depends on the financial situation of the student in question.  Um, if the student comes from a very comfortable financial situation, uh, one in which they are not worried about money, they are not taking up loans, uh, to complete their studies and they are not strapped for cash, so to speak, then it's perfectly reasonable for them to not have a part-time job so they can focus on their studies.  However, if the student in question, uh, is not coming from such a comfortable financial situation, uh, or in other words, if they are taking out student loans, if they are, um, not coming from a rich family or, uh, if they are like the majority of college students and finance is a ve  --  very much of a part of their concern and stra -- 
When I was at – I think it's very important when I was in university, I had two part-time jobs, uh, to make enough money that we pay for the stu – the student fees and for all my, uh, rental accommodation and for many bills like electricity and gas and everything.  I was lucky that I lived in a shared apartment with some friends and – but unfortunately, most of them worked full-time so it was a little bit hard sometimes trying to balance between doing your actual work and being with your friends and actually going and studying at the same time.  But again, I think it gives you a good sense of well-being and you know what it's going to be like as you get older and whether you'd be able to handle or how you need to work a little bit better, and it sets you up for interviews I think and it can give you quite a bit of life experience to talk about when you go for the interviews after you've graduated because you've been going on points of how you have balanced...
I both agree and disagree with the statement that these days it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I agree that for those students who have the time and the inclination to get a part-time job that they should be able to do so.  However, I – I disagree, uh, that – that students should get a part-time job, particularly for those students whose study load is too high for them to be able to juggle both work and study.  There are some disciplines where the – the study load is very high and where to get a part-time job would be counterproductive for the – the academic achievement of the student, uh, medicine, law, veterinary science, some engineering courses are – are those that come to mind in this respect.  I think it's important that governments fund universities and – and university students sufficiently so that they do not – are not required to have to get a part-time job.
I believe student should take part-time jobs to give them a valuable link to the world of work and help them to become mature.  I also think that a part-time job can help them to pay for their study fees, their tuition fees and help them to realize the value of their education.  I believe, of course, that education should be free, but this is perhaps unreasonable in the current economic climate and students I think are overly protected.  They need to realize that nothing comes for free that's why they should have part-time jobs.
Yes, I believe that it's very important that a college student should have a part-time job while he is in school.  The reason I believe this is because they need to learn how money doesn't grow on trees, that they have to work hard for that money and therefore they are going to use money correctly.  Another reason I believe this is because they need to have more structure in their life.  If they don't have structure, they are going to go off and do a lot of things that they probably shouldn't do.  But if they have structure, then they will be able to study harder and it will make them realize that every hour is important just by doing the work that makes them to not have as much time and therefore they need to really listen in the lectures because they know they are not going to have much time to study, and the more they learn in the lectures, the more they are not going to have to study at home or in their dorm wherever it maybe.  But they really need to really study hard in the lectures.  Therefore, I really truly believe that it's very important...
As I was saying, um, there is different ways that different people will view part-time work and the college experience, one thing that I have noticed that it seems to vary, um, very much by country.  So in the United States, college tuition is very, very expensive and while many families can afford to send their kids to college, uh, with, uh, government assistance or without government assistance, um, other families will have to use government assistance and then ask the students to work simultaneously, uh, either through the college employment office that would subsidize their tuition or the room and board or outside and then using that money towards tuition.  It's a big economic problem in the United States.  Uh, in Japan, I think that, um, from what I have seen and what I have heard, uh, a lot of part-time work is just a fun, uh, play time where, um, college tuition even at private schools.  So, it's nowhere near the amount of money required in the United States, but...
I agree that college student should have part-time jobs while they are in school because it will be good for them to prepare for internships.  Uh, the second reason will be they will be good to learn communication skills and third point will be because it will be good to learn team building skills.  For internships, um, the first reason, it will be good for students to, uh, get part-time jobs to prepare for their internships.  In my example, I interned at a TV company, um, but before my internship, I have also worked part-time.  So, I was able to use the skills that I have acquired at the part-time jobs at the internship.  Also, my second point, it will be good to learn communication skills there is that once we go out  --  graduate and go out into, um, the field and work full-time for a company, um, the communication skills that you've learned at part-time jobs will -- 
I think it's important for students to have a part-time job because they learn responsibility.  One way they learn it is, uh, as a worker, uh, because they need to fulfill their duties, uh, as an employee.  Another way that they learn responsibility is they – uh, they get money and with that they learn to manage their own budget.  If they are able to do that they will understand the value of money and, uh, also they und – that they – they learn the responsibility that is required to manage their own schedule.  If they are balancing their studies and their – um, their work hours, uh, they going to have to be a lot more organized than a student who is only studying full-time.  So, I think that it's important for students to have a part-time job if they can.  Uh, in addition, I think that, um, students can...
I partly agree with this question.  I think it is – it can be important for some students to have a part-time job.  Uh, it's mainly because they can learn some important skills, uh, for example, they can – uh, they can meet people that they normally wouldn't meet, uh, under university campus.  So they can meet, for example, older people, uh, and they can learn how to communicate with people and meet different kinds of people.  They can also learn about job responsibility and they can learn some job skills that may be helpful in their future.  On the other hand, I think that not all students must have a part-time job as some students have the luxury of not having to have a part-time job.  It can be good because they can focus on their studies.  Uh, they can have more free time to do what they'd like to do which is important university and they can also spend more time studying and doing their – their classroom work.  So, I partly agree with this topic.  Uh, it can be good for some students but it's not necessary for...
A lot of people think that college students should have part-time jobs because they provide interesting skills and important skills for later in their careers, but I am afraid that I must disagree and the reasons for this is that many students neglect their studies instead for a part-time jobs which provides important income for their leisure time.  However, uh, but due to the studies are suffering, it means that the skills that they would be, uh, developing, uh, in academia, um, are not, uh, quite as developed as they ought to be given the involvement on advanced field study.  Um, so therefore, I must disagree that a  --  a part-time jobs are important for college students.  Uh, it would be extremely rare that the student would be able to take anything more than an entry-level job.
I agree with the statement that college students should work while they are studying because first of all, it gives them discipline in their life.  It helps them to learn to set a schedule for they  --  for their life.  They have lot to do, lot of studies, a lot of work and they can learn to make a schedule and to live by that schedule.  It helps to develop good character, it helps to develop good work ethic, it helps to have a student who is not lazy and who provides for their needs and for their family and that is very important as they begin to, uh, live life.  Just studying is not the most important thing but learning to live life meaningful and to be able to, uh, uh, be dependent, uh, have people be able to be dependent upon you, it builds good character.  But also by, uh, uh, working a job you are living a disciplined -- 
Do I believe students should have a part-time job in university?  Yes, I do believe that it's true in the majority of the situations.  Part-time jobs provide real-world experience, they also provide a deviation from the rule, i.e., technically this is not correct, but in this situation it is the best option.  There is also the real-world experience of creating social skills belonging to a team, being a member who can play by the rule, making judgment by consensus, getting along with coworkers who may or may not be your friend and communicating with a manager or superior who you do not like.  They also teach different skills such as time management, self-motivation, and a different learning environment...
