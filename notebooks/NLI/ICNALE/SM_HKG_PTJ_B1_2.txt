I don't think that it is very important for college students to have a part-time job.  Nowadays part-time jobs are very common but the reasons – there are plenty [***] of reasons for students to take these jobs.  For some - first one is that taking these jobs the students can know what they want to do or they don't want to do in their future job.  For example, they maybe a private teacher as a part-time, for a part-time job and then you know that if they enjoy working with little – little children or if they are suitable for this task or not.  And second – second example is that working in a restaurant.  So – umm – they understand – they will know that this is not what they want and – or these things...

I agree with this sentence.  I think for college students it is important for them to have a part-time job because they can earn at work, experience from that.  Umm – college students have their major and some of them require to have actual working experience because they may not be able to learn them through textbooks or through lessons.  So, it is important for them to have [***] the experience and learn to deal with people.  And the second point is that they can earn more money for them because studying in university – umm – they will have more expenses than they were in secondary school.  So, with more income, they can lessen their – the burden of their families and – and they can also learn...

Today, some people say that students should have a part-time job when they are pursuing their study.  I agree with this statement.  There are three reasons behind this.  First, it is about time management.  Although we have to study and have a happy work load in our study, but having a part-time job can – we – so that we can manage time better in a more systematic way.  We know when we are free, when we are busy, so we can learn how to manage time earlier.  Second, the environment of work place and the environment of school, of studying are totally different.  I think students should learn how to communicate with colleagues and customers in – in earlier...

I don't think this is a question of whether a student should find a part-time job or should not find a part-time job.  It's just a matter of personal preference.  A lot of students – I think a lot of students find a part-time job because they want to earn extra money and to support the - to support the stuff that they do in their personal life, to buy more clothes, for whatever reasons, there are some of them to find jobs to pay for the tuition fee and some do it simply for the experience.  But you know there are people who – who don't have a part-time job like me because we – I currently prefer to have some time of my own because while if you have other academic work, you have 3 essays due in the same week but you still have to go to part-time job like...

I do agree that having a part-time job is important for college students nowadays.  First of all because it helps us kill time.  In other words that is to use our time appropriately and wisely.  As having a part-time job, we can strike to achieve a work-life balance between school life, academic results and work.  And from work, we can earn money that may alleviate our family burden or we can earn some money to use in our daily lives which is a benefit of having a part-time job.  And besides, having a part-time job help us find our interest maybe because after graduation, we may not know our direction of work or our interest, so...

I think it is important for university student to get a part-time job because right now the society have high expectations for the university students and I think if you want to be more competitive in the labor market, then it is better for you to get some experience before you go, you know, into the labor market.  I think a part-time job will be good.  I mean, you don't need to keep working part-time, however, long you are in the university.  Of course, you still have to do some you know study and you still want to enjoy your life as a student, but then I think it is necessary for you to gain some experience that I think a part-time job...

I agree with the statement.  I think it's important that the college students find a part-time job.  Firstly, I think the college student already have the ability to earn money, so that if they would like to have more activities or they need money to buy something they want, they should find a part-time job to earn money, but not rely on their parents too much.  Secondly, I think they can try to learn how to manage time better when doing the part-time jobs.  They can learn how to strike a balance between studies and also the part-time jobs.  For example, some tutoring or even some sales in the store.  Thirdly, again doing part-time jobs can help the college students gain more working experiences.  So, before they graduated, they can learn more, so they can do better afterwards.

I think it is essential for college students to do part-time jobs because firstly they can accumulate work experience by doing part-time job because as college students they want to find jobs after graduation.  If they like work experience, it may not be really beneficial for them to find jobs because I think when we find jobs, most employers will ask for job experience, work experience.  If we do not have any, then it will be disappointing to us [***] for sure and by doing part-time job, I think we can enrich our resume or CV by writing out all our work experience...

Well, I think that the students should have the part-time job, not because mainly, not mainly because of the nature or money but because of the personal development.  Well, personally, it is so important for one to acquire the academic knowledge and both the personal development, the social experience in the society.  This is because the in class role and lecture, they are only academic and knowledge and they may be involved in the academic environment, but they need some personal development which is outside the classroom and exists in society.  And in society through participating in part-time of course they earn some money, but most importantly, they have the opportunity to learn these things in the society.  For example, when they take part in a company, then they know how to...

In my opinion, students – college students should have a part-time job because they – when they graduate, thus they have to have some working experience, so that they can get the advantage of being hired by the company.  If they originally have some working experience that they know how to communicate with different people and learn how to cooperate with them, so their employer will have a higher, have – are willing to hire them.  If they do not have part-time experience, then they may not have a very good advantage of this because they are very new to the job and they don't know what...

Umm – I think it is not necessary for college students to take a part-time job, but then still it is a really good experience for them to experience what it is like to work in society.  You know for college students, normally they have a pretty busy life, like to focus on their academic work and also other activities in college.  Of course, I think university students should enjoy their college life that they have to spend more time with their friends and college, but then still I think they can spend more time – some time on part-time job because after graduation we have to immediately step ourselves into society and if we can have a part-time job right in our university life, then we can be more prepared for our future career.  So, I think it is good to have a part-time job...

Okay, I do agree that college students should have a part-time job because doing the part-time job is not just about earning money.  I think college students should have some experience in the society.  When doing the part-time job, you really have a chance to get into the society and really experience what it is like when you are working in a workplace environment.  It is not just studying and nowadays a lot of students are criticized because of their lack of responsibility, their lack of life experiences and that's why I think doing a part-time job is indeed a great opportunity for them to get more experience, get more life experience, and communicate with others.  When they are working, really working in the future, they can really use...

Umm - as a student I think that it is important thing for students to get a part-time job because there are lots of things that can't be learned from our schools or from textbooks.  Just like me, I worked as part-time waitress before.  I think that I really learned a lot.  For example like dealing with strangers, with my customers and – umm – if I didn't work for part-time job, I never have such experience, so that I can be more confident while dealing with different kinds of people.  Also, I think that part-time job is useful for dealing too much with the society before they get a real – regular job because there they can learn to deal with the colleagues, and so that they can be more sophisticated...

I agree with the statement that university students should get a part-time job – for – because there are very strong reasons or things that I believe that the university is another very important stage in life between high school and before you really step into the uni – the society to work for your full-time job.  So, it is a – a very important time for the student to try to strike a balance between work and studying – umm – because it is important for university students to study but at the same time they have to taste or they have to try how the reality or real society look – is like.  So, trying to take a part-time job can let them to know how hard – umm – to earn money or to earn living and...

Yes, I do agree with the statement that a college p – student should get a part-time job, because I think if they get a part-time job they can earn their own living and they don't – they – no need to rely so much on their family fund because for college the tu – tuition fee is already quite expensive.  If the student can have a part-time job they can... hmm... have a less – umm – less financial burden on their family. Besides, um, getting a part-time job can also let them gain more ex – working experience before graduation.  Also normally passed graduates, they do not have much work – uh – work experience which makes their work experience like um less likely than others.  Therefore, having a part-time job can help them to gain some more working experience and contact more people.  They can learn some interpersonal...

I think I agree with this statement.  I think that college students – it is important for the college students to have at least one part-time job because I think part-time jobs can help prepare college students with their abilities or experience for the future.  For example, most college students in Hong Kong will have some tutoring jobs which they help primary students or secondary students do – for their homework and I think it can – the tutoring jobs can help them refresh their past knowledge of...

I agree with the topic because firstly I think college students need to have a part-time job so as to support their college work such as any daily spending or any spending with friends.  And if they are already a college student, they need to take up their own responsibility and not to rely on their parents.  And having a part-time job would – would help them provide an opportunity for them to really take up a job and to – and to earn their daily spending.  And secondly, I think the college students need a part-time job as to accumulate experience for their future career because for their part-time jobs they can learn different skills like really a practical working experience and any communication skills.  These are also important for their future career and so as to accumulate more experience in their CV and to convince...

These days people always say that it is important for college students to get part-time job and I strongly agree with this notion.  The most fundamental reason for that is many college students need extra income for covering their living or academic expense.  For example, they may need money for buying reference books, they may also need money for – for entertainment.  So, the most realistic reason for having a part-time job is definitely to earn more income.  Secondly, part-time job offers an excellent opportunity for...

These days some people say that it is important for college students to have a part-time job and I totally agree with it.  First of all, getting a part-time job, you can have the remuneration as your money to really want and students who have a part-time job can use the money to finance their daily expenses, such as transportation, and the buying of textbooks and college students usually have many gatherings with friends and classmates, and they will spend a lot on buying gifts for each other as well.  So, the money can be used to shoulder their financial burden.  Apart from it, doing a part-time job, students can learn invaluable ex -- 
Um.  These days many people said – say that – um – it is important for college students to have a part-time job and personally I agree with this statement.  I think part-time job – um – brings lots of positive effect to college students.  First of all – um – part – uh – through the part-time jobs college students are able to learn – uh – to earn money for their living – um – you know, in the university or in the college many of the – uh – expenditures are used – uh – for example, for their learning or for their life. So, if they participate in a part-time job they are able to earn their own money and other than that the second reason is that – um – you can learn more than what you can learn in your school in the part-time job, for example, the – um – uh – relationship with others and some of the things that you cannot experience in the college.  So, I think it is very important for the university students...

Um.  I think it is very important for a college student to get a part-time job. Although some may argue that – uh – it will cause distraction for students, for example like they will just work to earn money instead of – uh– working hard in their studies, but I think college students have – uh – the responsibility – their own responsibility and also their self-discipline to how to strike a balance between their studies and their work life, and I think also getting a job can train their independence, and also help alleviate their financial stress – uh – because the tuition fee from – uh – university is quite high, for example like – uh – 40 something thousand a – a year, so – uh – getting a part-time job can also help – um – alleviate the stress from the family because – uh– the family has to pay...

I agree that – uh – college students – uh – necessary for them to have part-time job.  As first and foremost, they can gain their work experience.  As you know that college students, the next step for them is to enter the new – social market or they may have a job, so they have to gain work experience in order to have prepared for their social life, and besides they can know how to communicate with different kinds of people. You have to meet different kind of people when you come out to the society, so this may be a great chance for them to learn more, and know how to communicate, cope with their stresses or interpersonal skills or time management, there are so much benefits – so more – many benefits of having a part-time job, and – um – besides they can make more friends and gain more money for their life...

Uh.  I think it is important for a college student to have a part-time job – um.  As for myself I have a lot of part-time jobs; I work as a sales advisor, and also as a – oh I also tutor some – um – students from high school and primary school.  Well, I think it is important for college students to do – as part-time jobs, because it is a way for them to learn – uh – how to manage their money better, and how to, you know, communicate with other people in terms of – um – uh – teamwork, and to build – to express themselves...
It is important for college students to have a part-time job because firstly they can know what they want to do or they don't want to do in their future career by doing a part-time job.  For example, working in a restaurant – in a restaurant will make them feel that these labor force work are not suitable for them or they really and – on the other hand they really enjoyed it, so they will like it.  The second reason is that they develop skills that they needed for future career.  For example, being a college teacher myself, I know that being patient, listening to my boss, other is very important – are very important and some people will say that college students are busy with their studies, they don't have time to take up the job but then they – if they are busy, they can choose some job...

I agree with this statement.  I think it is important for college students to earn more work experience through part-time job because in secondary school, they don't really have chances to work in the society.  When they need to work in a – in a company or in an organization, they can learn to deal with people and can enhance their interpersonal relationship.  Secondly, they can earn – earn more money of course because when they study in the University, - umm – they may have lots of expenses like they need to eat, they need to maybe buy clothes for them.  Umm – with more money, they can lessen the burdens of their families and at the same time, they can know how to manage their own money.

Some people say that students should have a part-time job when they are [***] pursuing their studies.  I agree with this statement because time management is very important in our life.  When you are a student, you may only have to study and finish your homework and that's all.  But if the students can have a part-time job outside school [***], so that they can manage their time between work and studies.  Second, I think that environment at workplace will be a totally different, so they should learn how to communicate with colleagues and customers in their part-time job, so they can prepare earlier for their future career.  Third, I think money and it's a very important factor that puts students to work because they are...

I think students should have their own choice on this matter.  I don't think we should say that, ‘oh, they should find job or they shouldn't.'  Because there are people who want to make money in their free time, people who want to earn experience before they find a real job and people who want to like – who need to find a job to support their tuition fee.  But I also think that people have the freedom to not to find a part-time job.  You know, like me, I don't have a part-time job because I want to have more time on my own.  I am insecure about job.  I need time to think about my life and also because sometimes when you have like essay due, presentation on the same week and then still you have to go to work for 2 days and you don't have time to do your own stuff.  So, I think it is not a matter of what...

I agree that having part-time jobs in college life is important because it has various benefits.  First of all, it helps us to balance our work life, balance as in college life, we have to study and besides study we can choose to work when we have spare time, that is we can – during the process, we can strike a work life balance and we can learn to use our time wisely.  It is important in the aspect of time management.  Also, in the part-time job, we can earn money though it may not be a lot of money but those amount can help alleviate our family burden that family members don't need to give us much money and we can use the money earned in our daily life.  Also, it helps us...

Umm – I think it is important for students to have a part-time job because now with that [***] – the society has higher expectation for university student.  So, I think the job will [***] some life experience before they enter the labor market.  Umm – also I think a part-time job can – can be a different kind of learning experience because [***] apply what we learn in school for the past 20 years in to – you know the job [***] gain some handsome experience for have [***] knowledge that we have learned in school.  Yes, so, I think...

I agree with the statement.  I think nowadays it's important for the college students to find their own part-time jobs.  Firstly, I think it's normal that the college students should find a part-time job to earn their money if they want to achieve [***] and have more activities because I think actually college students are adults, so they actually have the abilities to earn money, but not rely so much on their parents.  Secondly, I think finding a part-time job can learn – the college students to learn more about the time management, so they can learn how to strike a balance between studies and part-time jobs.  But we – I think it's important for the college students to gain more working experiences before they graduate.  The part-time job likes tutoring can help their – those students who would like to be teachers in the future, gain more experiences.  So, I think it's important for them to...

I think it is essential for college students to do part-time job during their study time in university because first, it can – it can help them accumulate work experience.  Also graduation they can write their work experience in their resume or CV, so that when they have the job interview in the future, when the employers, interviewers ask for their resume, they have something to say.  And by doing part-time job, I think students can also acquire different work skills, maybe communication skills, interpersonal skills or some other practical skill such as maybe clerical work, administrative work, so that actually it can be very beneficial.  And secondly, doing part-time job can for sure help student earn some money, maybe I think student can do part-time job to...

I think that students should have the chance to take part in the part-time because – not only because of the money but because of most importantly the personal development.  With no doubt students can learn a lot academic knowledge in the classroom, but however, there are some personal development outside the classroom for example, when take part – taking part in, when having a part-time in society, for example in big cooperation, you need to deal with the administration and most importantly you can deal with the personal relationship.  Say for example, how to deal with the staff, with another employee, and how to stay more close with other people and this is very important.  It's about the soft skills.  It's about the – how you treat peoples, relationship and which is toward outside the classroom.  So, if we do not...

I think nowadays colleges students should have a part-time job because they will gain upper hand if they have some previous working experience related to the jobs they will apply in the future.  The employer often like to employ some students or graduates who have already have some working experience on the particular job, so that they don't have to spend more time to teach them what to do and how to deal with the situation.  Also, if the students have working experience, then they can learn how to cooperate with different people and they will know how to work as a team.  So that is beneficial for both the college students and employers.  So, I think college students should have a part-time...

As I have just mentioned, it is not necessary for college students to have part-time job but then it will be a very good experience for them to take a part-time job and now I'd like to talk a little bit about some risk of having a part-time job because we - college students, they may have – they want to earn money or they want to like experience what is society – job is like, but then they may risk their academic life and also their social life in university as well because for a lot of students, they want to earn money.  That's why they take a lot of part-time jobs, but then when they take up so many part-time jobs they just do not have enough mo – time to spend with their families or friends and even they just couldn't manage to work on their academic field.  So, I think the most important thing is for them to study and if they have spare time and they can work part – take up a part-time job...

I think nowadays a lot of college students are being criticized because of lack of responsibility and having not enough life experiences and that's why I do think that they need to work on some part-time jobs.  It is because working on part-time job can make them more experienced.  They can see more things.  They can really enter the society and experience what it is like out there.  It's not just in the school or in the college, they are immersed themselves – themselves in the books and then earning knowledges and that's why I think they really need to enter the society, experience what it is like out there and then – work on something real.  It is not just like theories.  It is like something practical.

As I stated, I think that getting a part-time job is important for students' personal growth and their social life because there are lots of things that can't be learned from school.  For example, I have worked as a part-time waitress before.  I had to deal with different kinds of strangers while they are my customers.  So that I can be more confident and sophisticated while dealing with different kinds of people.  Also, it is important for students to – umm – merge with the society before they get regular job.  They have - students can learn to get along well with their colleagues and to be more sophisticated and improve their communication skills.  Now, instead of [***] I really encourage that students have a part-time job to help themselves to have a more thorough personal growth.  This is good for...

I agree with the statement that university students to get – to get a part-time job nowadays.  I think it is very important for university students as a very – they are experiencing some of the sort of like important days in their life.  It is driving [***] between studying and starting to deal with the real society.  So, taking a part-time job can lead them to have a try to taste what the real society is like, how to – how hard it is to learn a living for themselves.  It is also beneficial for them to try to search for their interest for their job or ambition through the part-time job before they really get their fulltime job and their lifelong goal.  So, this is a very good experience – oh yeah – especially a learning experience.

Um.  I do agree with the statement that the college students should get a part-time job that – because first of all they can earn their own livings, they do not need to rely so too much on their family because for a college student the to – tuition fee is already quite expensive, and it is a financial burden to their own family.  If they can get a part-time job, they can make some pocket money and they do not rely on their family so much. Apart from that, they can also gain some working experience before graduations.  For them – for a normal college student – for a best graduate it should be – they do not have such – uh – so much working experience to make – make them quite difficulties in writing their own resume this – therefore if they can get a part-time job they can gain some working experience, contact more people, and they can also learn some more about international – interpersonal skills, then how do deal with customer or how to deal with daily...

I think it's important for the college students to have a part-time job because I think having job experiences can help college students prepare themselves for the future – umm – because when they have some job experiences they can – umm – maybe sharpen their interpersonal skills or communication skills.  For example, many people apart from – uh – having tutoring experiences, most people will apply for internship in Hong Kong.  For example, I have applied for an internship in government, so I think it's a golden chance for me to know about the organization and I think it's useful for me if I want to apply for the government...

I agree with the topic because personally I think that college students should accumulate more experience in their – for their future career because they need to – umm – take up different careers and to accumulate like hands-on – hands experience, so as to convince their future employers they have the necessary skills and they can really handle different jobs.  Secondly, I think the students should take up part-time job as they should not rely on their teachers – their parents for different – daily spending.  They should be responsible themselves and to take up their life.  I think it is important for them to try a part-time job, so as to really learn how like – how tough their parents are when doing a job and to – umm – give consideration so as to really help their parents in the future.

These days people always say it is important for college students to get a part-time job and I strongly agree with this notion.  The most fundamental reason for having a part-time job is definitely to earn more income.  Nowadays, most college students need money to cover their academic or living expenses like they have to pay for – they have to buy reference books or they have to pay for their entertainment.  So, the most realistic reason for having part-time job is definitely to earn more income and secondly having a part-time job can offer students with tons of experience with the job they are interested in.  So, part-time job actually provides an excellent opportunity for students to get valuable insights into their future career path and so I strongly agree...

These days some people say that it is important for college student to have part-time job, I totally agree with it.  Almost every college student has a part-time job.  They can use the money earned to pay for their daily expenses, for example transportations, and the buying of textbooks.  Also, university students have many gatherings with friends and their classmates, so they will also spend a lot of mo  --  of money on  --  uh  --  meals and buying presents for each other.  Getting a part-time job can help them to shoulder their financial burden.  Also, they can learn invaluable experience from doing a part-time job.
This day some people say that college students should have their part-time job.  I think it is – I agree with this statement, because I think part-time jobs can real – part-time jobs can really bring positive effect to students. First of all, it is – uh– where the children – uh – the students can earn their livings and – uh – for their college life – um – because as – as we all know the school fees are very expensive in nowadays, and students have to like pay a lot of other expenditures, for example they have to – uh – pay when they have their meals or for their – um – transportation, so in a part-time job they are able to earn their living and personally I think tutorials is really a good part-time job for them because – uh – they can really learn how to earn a living in a really not so desirable environment and therefore it's – I think it is important...

Um.  I think getting a part-time job for the college student is very important and also beneficial to them.  Uh. Although some may argue that – uh – getting a part-time job may cause distraction to the students, because they cannot strike a balance between – uh – getting a job or – and also their studies – so – um – it will cause distraction and they will not work hard, but I think – uh – it can also train their independence and because they have to know how to strike a balance between their work and studies, so – um – it can train them to be a better person in the future, and also – um – getting a part-time job can help alleviate the financial stress from the family because – uh – paying such a large amount of tuition fee is – maybe – uh – it's quite hard for some families – uh – paying like 40 something thousands – uh – each year.

So, I agree with the point that college students are used – um – should have a part-time job when they are – when they are studying, and the first and foremost point will be they can get – gain working experience.  As you know that college students – next step for them is to enter the society, they have to find a job, so gaining a work experience is to well – is a very good step for them to well equip before going to the society, and they have to know how to communicate with different people. As I have mentioned going to the society means that you have to cope with stress, you have to interact with people, so you can learn a lot from your part-time job; handling stress, time management, interpersonal skills, there are some too many benefits that I could mention for a part-time job, and besides you can earn money.  College students already spend a lot.  They have – they have to pay their school fees, so they have to – they'll build up their own money concept, and of course they can – um – earn more money to support their family or even support their leisure activities and important...

Um.  I think it is important for college students to have part-time jobs, because – um – it is a very good way for them to learn how to manage their spending, and also – um – learn how to express themselves, and how to communicate with others.  Um.  These abilities, I think – um – are very important for their future because – um – no one is going to teach them – uh – when they graduate.  So, um – before graduation I think it is better for them to learn and get some experience, so that – um – in the future in their company, well, it is easier for them to find a company – um – because relatively it may be better for the employer – company to hire some...
