I disagree to the statement.  Smoking must prohibit in a restaurant.  There are few reasons why I think this way.  Firstly, smoking is not help – helpful for health – so secondly, smoking task – smoking task is very good to adult people.  Lastly, indirect smoking is very...

In my opinion smoking should be thoroughly banned in all the restaurant around the country because smoking is a bad – kind of bad habit to influence to other people who don't smoke.  For example, when people enter the restaurant and there is someone who smoke, people feel irritated – to avoid that place and they never – never go again there.  Therefore, smoking in the public location should be banned not only to make up fresh and clean environment, but to let people have nice habits without [***] for smoking.  In addition, smoking makes people get some health problems.  Tobacco has lots of bad materials like nicotine...

In my case, I am not a person who smoke, and my dad doesn't smoke also.  And, you know, smoking is really harmful to smokers not only – not only smokers, actually, but also people around the smoker.  So I think it may be very better to ban the smoking especially in the public.  It may be very inflammatory and harmful to everyone, and environment also.  We should be banned, smoking in the public area all over the world not only in Korea, but also in Japan also.

I disagree that speech.  Because the smoking is obviously [***] but smoking is – some people – smoking is that some people pay the right money and it is the favorite thing.  They have the right that enjoy the smoking, but I think [***] regulation should – should be set up.

I think it's unfair for smoker, and country completely on depend smoking in country, so because even though I am not old smoker, but smoking is also the option for life, so everybody in my country should – should conserve their option or likes, so smoking in my country is completely fair.  It play if they are penalty when...

I strongly agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all the restaurant in the country.  First of all, there are many people who are – who are not smokers, so in the restaurant, so if someone smokes then other people will be uncomfortable about it, so – and they can even get – they can even get a upset about it, so it should be banned at all restaurants.  And second, restaurant is perused [***] not for smoking.  There are smoking places near restaurant, so they – smokers can use those kind of places to smoke, so it doesn't matter to smokers if they – if they are banned to smoke at restaurants.  And third, for the [***] who are...

I think... I agree this opinion because smoking is not good to people's health if they smoking on the area like restaurant.  Some people doesn't smoking – can – can – can – can – can – smoking – uhh – uhh...

I think smoking should not be strictly – strictly banned in all the countries.  The reason why I think like is that smoking has many positive – positive things.  For example, by doing smoking, you can relieve your stress.  When you smoke, you can relieve your stress and but if this is strictly banned, you can do that, so when you get too much stress, you can find ways to relieve your stress.  Sometimes it can be [***], so I think the strictly banning smoking is very dangerous, and also smoking is good for – for the economy of developed countries.  As you know, developed countries...

I agree with that statement.  Smoking should be banned in any country because it's very bad for – bad for health, but from smokers and [***] smokers smoke on the street or restaurants or cafeteria; it's very bad to non-smokers, so also it has addic – addic – addiction, so it's very bad – also because of that, people spend much money and also they spend much money to see a doctor.

I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned in the country.  And there are several reasons to support my opinion.  First, it is not very unhealthy to the smokers and also the people – people around smokers.  As normally we can easily see the people who are smokes – smoking around especially in on the outside, and I think it is really bad thing to people who do not smoke at all, especially to me.  And also it create a lot of air pollution.  It can create – create air pollution a lot, so – uhh – not only for the smokers, but also the people who do not...

I agree this statement.  Obviously, I think it should banned in the restaurant because it can harmful to other people in restaurant.  In restaurant we enjoy our meal.  We can – we should be – we should be enjoy our meal healthfully but it smoking – it can harm – harm to other people and reduce their...

I agree with the statement that smoking is completely banned all over the country because I think there are two reasons.  And first, smoking is not good for our health.  If people smoking for long-time, people could get cancer more easily, and smoking is – smoking cause many disease.  Umm – or second, passive smoking is worse than the smoking.  And according to the study, the people who effected by first smoking could get cancer easily.  So...

In my opinion smoking has to be banned because if nothing [***] is we have to pay for the smoking, and it is quite costly.  And also if nothing happen to your health, health, like lung cancers and many kinds of disease it can – it can [***].  So I think smoking is not helpful but many people – as many people say that we have to respect the someone's right to buy things, so do what they want to do, so...

Well, I think there is this – I disagree with the statement because – uhh – smoking is a favor, so we could ban to smoking, where generally I am a woman so – I am a woman and I am not – I am not smoking – smoker, and so well actually for woman – uhh – smoking is not good because we – someday we have a baby, and we can – uh – pregnant, so – so smoking is not good for woman.  But sometimes – sometimes we can – we can – we can research for stress doing...

I disagree with the statement because smoking is the private thing, so we don't have to ban smoking because it is something like invasion about what they do and what they want to, so it should – it should not banned to smoking about the people because – umm – smoking is some kind of –uhh – some kind of hobby, so – uh – it can a private thing and it should be privatized, so we don't have to ban smoking people.  But...

Um – I think the cigarette in the world – the cigarette price in the world is getting expensive and everybody knows – definitely knows it is – smoking is not good for their health.  And also it makes their body worse and worse, so I don't think there is one thing in a good way, so I think that people who are smoking should quit smoking right away, and they have to know how can – how they can improve their health condition and – umm...

I think it is a crime to smoke in public places.  Everyone knows that smoking is a threat to the health of all people.  I also have already such bad smokers.  The public space is the place used by everyone.  They come and smoke, we have a big [***] on elderly and young children, although most people knows this fact, they are still smoking in public places.  Thus, really developed countries have imposed high fines to them.  This is a [***] but I think also that is the problem of social skills.  In the individualistic society, it causes such a problem at times.  Korea has recently expanded to no smoking area to solve this problem.  Currently [***], I agree to the...

Uh – as a smoker I disagree about it – uh – because all – I – I know smoking ha – affects other people – very unhealthy effect – uh – but government ha – has permitted company to make cigarette and permitted to sell it that means cig...smoking is part of business and these kind of – uh – government like Korea or Japan maybe America they ensure business – doing business and smoking as well as I said – smoking is part of business.  They should per...
Uh – I think it can be totally – I think it's not going to be banned – uh – in whole country.  First reason that I disagree with this is that it is of – it is violating a person's liberty and freedom.  Of course, it is harmful for thereselves [***] and other people, but I think it is – uh – one right that a person can – uh – pursue, and second reason is that it is unrealistic to ban all smoking.  Uh – it will only cause – uh – side-effects and the black market with become – will be – uh – be originated from those banning policy.
Smoking in restaurant or other place they smoke – no – no-smoking area is of course bad because – um – non-smokers is always – always undergo damage.
Yes, I – I agree.  It should be completely banned, because smoking has no benefit.  Uh – I mean it is only good for doing harm.  I heard it contains – it contains tar – um – a lot of – uh – cancer causing agents maybe – cancer causing agents, and also – um – involuntary smoking can hurt other people's health too even though...
I totally agree with the fact that smoking is complete – smoking should be completely banned in public and all places because even though smoking is a personal choice but it could harm other people including – uh – including smokers themselves, so it should be banned.  Should prevent those bad things that could happen to any – that could happen to anybody.  Uh – smoking – I respect their decision to smoke, but if it's harm – if it's harmful to – uh – people around them that would be a bad decision, so...
I agree that the smoking is very not good for many people.  Sometimes – sometimes many major [***] school students are having smoking.  It is very not – not good their health and their mental environment.  Also, in my case – I – my case my friend I have a friend the name is Jane she is really smoker but she is young but she have any disease caused that – caused smoking so I think smoking is very not good for many people for their health.
I think we should completely ban smoking publicly because first of all it's hurting other people's health.  When the smoker walks in the streets and they are smoking the per – people walking behind them they are breathing all this smoke so it's not good for both the smoker and the people who's walking behind them.  Second of all, I think it's making the streets very dirty because I saw 70% of the people – 70% of the smoker just – just abandons their...
No smoking cannot be banded for whole country because there are still probably lots of smokers who cannot stop smoking immediately any time for fixed habits and the government should not push them to stop smoking because it's not that easy  --  easing simple thing to do.  Lot of predictions or symptoms and side effects of simply blocking the smoking so they have to give some space for smokers and -- 
I disagree well the opinion that a – the smoking is – smoking has completely banded this is because even though smoking is really bad and it's influence several and many – many bad effect this is kind of – kind of – kind of habit to smoker and so they can ban and we need to make or we need to change the regulation for smoking for the companies to be banned.  It's not good smoking I think.
I think banning smoking all over the country is not fair because we don't have any – we don't have any sufficient place to smoke everywhere for example if the smokers want to smoke in the street they have no – they cannot find any place to smoke everywhere – especially we – for example on the university or other public – public buildings has the specific or special place for smokers so I know of course the – in the public – in the view of public health smoking outside or anywhere is not good but we have to understand and we have to admit and respect the – the rights of smokers.
I agree that smoking should be banned in the cont – country and there are some reasons.  First of all, it is not good for – it is not good for health not only for smoky – smoker but also for people who are next to them.  For example, when father is smoking at home it must – it must have bad effect on their children and their wife.  Also, it is not good for the pro – pregnant women and children.  Secondly, well nowadays in government they increased the taxes for cigarettes because they want people not to smoke.
I disagree because if we – uh – if we ban all the smoking acting like – about that because – umm – it will be more ineffective because – umm – if – if – if the law is made for ban all the smoking but all the – some people will just smoke even it is banned and so it – it will make a side effects for example some people not listening to law will just smoke everywhere like – uhh – yeah – smoke everywhere about not – not up...
I disagree with the statement because tax income from cigarettes is – I heard that – that it's quite large part of their tax income so if the government banned the cigarettes and they will also lose their tax income and they need to find out more tax income through other ways and this will be – it will make people more angry and feel bad and – in addition smokers also register policy because it is kind of their flavor so it is...
I strongly agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants.  Firstly, restaurant is a public occasion and place which indicates that people come to the place and want to enjoy theirself or a meal however smoking will really disturbs their [***] in terms of their health if – if – as it exerts bad smell and bad [***] so it will render bad effect on them.  It's wrong.  Furthermore, smoking should be banned in terms of their health or [***] smoking is kind of – it's known that it will cause cancer and bad effects on the your health matter so it is not good to have allowing them to smoke in restaurants.
Well, I think that the smoking should banned all – should banned all nation because firstly so the smoking is really, really bad for another people and all the people so many pe – well every year many people was – many people was – has been di – has been dead – has been dead by smoking so well and also many people – many people well paid a lot of money for their medication so you – the smoking should banned all the nation well they don't have to pay the hospital – hospital – hospital fare so well they can say...
I agree with this topic because anywhere some people doesn't – some people doesn't smoking so if someone does smoking they don't want to smell smoking smoke and every – everyone already know smoking is very harmful and not healthy so many people don't want to know that...
I agree with the idea that smoking should be completely banned in the public place in the country because I admit that smokers have a right to smoke but I want to say that smoking affects the other people's health and I think it is not – it's not right because all – all nonsmokers have to – nonsmokers have to endure the smoking but they – they don't smoke but they have to – to harm on their health because they don't want to smoke but smokers smoke in public place and...
I agree with this topic that smoking completely banned at all the restaurants and country because all people have a way to life.  If – if the – if the – if we don't banned the smoking at many places all the other persons who don't smoke they are very bad – very bad so I think usually protect our people's the rights you have to completely ban the smoking at all the restaurants and country and also indirect smoking is more bad – more bad than direct smoking so smokers – if smokers want to...
In this case I also agree – I also agree with this claim because we have right to – we have right to hate the smoke and the smells actually the smells and smoke is so disgust doesn't it so I agree – I agree to ban the smoke area and the...
Hmm, smoking must prohibit in the restaurant.  There are few reasons why I think this way.  Firstly, smoking is bad – smoking is – isn't good to health for me.  Secondly, lot of people hate smoking gas because in – uhh – in smoking gas there are many bad substance.  It is very unhealthful, so I think smoking must prohibit in the restaurant.

Tobacco has lots of bad materials like nicotine, tar, and many other harmful matters which relate to blood cancer.  And also – yeah, in addition to what I said in the previous question, smoking banning – stop smoking can make many good – many advantages like letting people have nice habits except for smoking that – yeah, for example, people who do not – who don't smoke usually can – can save – could save their money and use their money to for other nice habits or...

In my opinion, I think smoking should be banned in the public area all over the world because I have heard that some accidents from – because of cigarette, from a smoker.  In my case, I am not a person who smoke, and my dad doesn't smoke at all.  We know it is really harmful to the smoker – not only smoker but also some people around the smoker, so I think smoking in the public area should be banned all over the world, not only in Korea but also Japanese, Canada, America, Australia, British, anywhere.  It's for our earth environment also, and our love...

I disagree with that topic.  Uhh – first, smoking is obviously harmful to someone, some people, but the other – other people have pay – pay their money to that, and smoking is very [***], but culturally – uh – culture regulation should be setup.  Example, for example, uh, smoking zone in the restaurant can be help – can help that.

Uh – in my opinion, uh, in restaurant, smoking in restaurant is completely banned – should be completely banned because – uh – everybody in restaurant is non-smoker, but some of them is just smoker, they can be smoke outside of restaurant, so non-smoker and smoker right is conserved in that way, so it's fair comparing in smoking in restaurant is fair, so for every restaurant should then smoking in their restaurant.  In my case, I am non-smoker, so I hate smoker...

I think I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned at all restaurants in the country.  Firstly, there are many people who are – who are not smokers, so they can feel – they will feel uncomfortable about other people smoking at the same place.  As for me, I really hate the smoke of the cigarette, so I try to avoid the situation with the – with smokers.  And second, smoking is not only good for – not only bad for on-smokers but also really, really bad for the smokers.  People banned smokers to use cigarettes in the public place – then smokers should – will think about getting their smoking habit.

I agree this opinion because smoking is not good for health to people – uhh – uhh – even though non-smoking person can smell a smoke, so it is no good to health, so it – so – uhh – umm – have some – it will have to prohibit smoking in public area like restaurants, park, school.

As I told you – umm – smoking is good for the economy of developed countries.  As you know, developed countries import low cigarette leaf, but if smoking is strictly banned, the other countries can export the cigarette leaf that is best for the economy of developed country, so I think for the balance of economy of all around the world, I think smoking should not be banned strictly.  And also by using – if smoking is strictly banned, people will find other ways to relive stress.  It can be violence or other much more dangerous activities, such as...

I think this is a very good restaurant because – because these days many people get stress because of the smokers.  But in this restaurant you don't need to worry about it, worry about that, so you can enjoy your food very well.  Also, smokers can stop their smoking or their having a meal here.  It's very good try to build this restaurant.  Also, I – I absolutely agree to the propose of that.  Also, non-smoke...

I totally agree that smoking should be completely banned in the country.  And there are several reasons to support my opinion.  First, I think it is not healthy for smokers and also the people who do not smoke.  And, you know, smoking can create a lot of cancer like [***] cancer, so it is just not good for the people health.  And second, it create a lot of air pollution, so it is not good for the environmental things.  So for this reasons I think smoking should be completely banned in the country and the area.

I agree this statement obviously.  I think it should banned in restaurant because smoking can harmful to – can be harmful to other people in restaurant and other people offset should – can offset because of smoking people.  Second reason I agree this statement is it reduce other people's taste and – umm – quality – it reduce quality of – umm – meals, quality of meals and...

So I agree with the statement that smoking is completely banded in all over the country – all over the country, which has three reasons.  Umm – first, smoking is not good for our health.  If people smoke for a long time, they can get cancer more easily and smoking cause many diseases.  Secondhand smoking is worse than the smoking, so the people who [***] those smoking could then – could get cancer more easily.  Also, tobacco price is getting expensive.  If people do not smoke, they can save their money.

I think one of them the smoking – we have to respect many people's idea like so moderately just restricting the smoking is the good idea, I think.  It is the fact that smoking is harmful, but we do many rights that people has, so I think – uhh – like – umm – increasing the tobacco's cost or stores, decreasing the stores that serves the tobacco – cigarettes, yeah.  So regulatory...

Well, I think I disagree with this statement because doing smoking or not doing smoking is their will, so we can – we cannot [***], we shouldn't then smoking.  Well, actually I am a woman and I am – I am non-smoker and – but I generally, thankfully, woman doing smoking is not for woman because woman someday – someday have a baby or can pregnant, so the smoking is not good for women.  But I don't care about in case of men because – because during society, a thing like doing job, in that time...

I agree with the statement about non-smoking at a restaurant because non-smoker dislike smoking people because it is harmful for their health and lungs, so it can be a great disaster for the non – non-smoker.  So smoking people should not smoke at the restaurants, but they have – so they have to go out and smoke at the outside of the restaurant.  If they smoke at the restaurant – smoke in the restaurant, it could be a very bad thing for the non-smoker, and – and it's really the baby at the restaurant that could be avoid [***]... harmful of the baby, so it should be banned for...

I think smoking in the restaurant definitely is not good and – and usually the most of the studying [***], there are so many children and people maybe who are not smoking, so I think they might – might be distracted by people who are smoking so much.  And – and also most people know, smoking is not good for their health and it makes their body also worse, so smoking is definitely – should be banded in the restaurant and...

Restaurant is a public place.  I think it is okay to smoke in public places.  Everyone knows that smoking is a threat to the health of all people.  I also have the awareness to such facts as smokers.  The public space is the place used by everyone.  Secondhand smoke will have a big impact on pregnant women, the elderly, and young children.  Although, most people knows this fact, they are still smoking in public places.  Thus, many developed country have imposed high fines to prevent it.  This is a matter of concerns, but I think also that is the problem of a social skills, individualistic society its cost such a program at all times.  Korea has recently expanded toward non-smoking area to solve these problems.  I totally agree to this policy, and I also will – I will...

But in consider – in considering about unhealthy effect about – to somebody smoking is in restrict place like it's not public place like subway or bus station that's not – that maybe forbidded but irony thing is Korean government doesn't – I – I don't feel – I don't feel they are doing – making nonsmoking person making.  They don't make – they – they make company to very dangerous people of...
I think the smoking has to be banned for all the restaurants in the country because the restaurants are for the people who [***] they paid for their money to enjoy the – enjoy those foods and time but smoking can violate other people's freedom and happiness to enjoy their food so that's why I agree with banning – banning the smoking for all the restaurants in the country.  Of course they have a right to do what they want but other people have to suffer for – from one person's behavior so I think it is not right...
No smoking in restaurants I agree because nonsmokers have the rights  --  right to protect from smoke.  Everyone know that smoke  --  smoke is not healthy in your body so I agree with that.
Yes, I agree it should be completely banned because smoking has no benefits I mean it is only good for doing harm.  It contains nicotine, tar, or a lot of cancer causing agents and also involuntary smoking can hurt other people's health too and also can hurt their feelings and if smokers threw their cigarettes out on the road or everywhere they could – that could make the streets dirty.  So, smoking should be completely – completely...
So, I respect their decision but people should make their own decision according to their sake and other people's sake so smoking should be banned completely and it's kind of important for individuals and government to try harder to prevent that or try hard – try harder to completely eradicate the smoking culture – smoking atmosphere try – try not to harm other people's life – lives and...
Smoking in the restaurant is very – is have to prohibited because there are many nonsmoker and smoker but nonsmokers think smoking is very not good and they don't want to – they don't want to experienced that – that atmosphere for using their smoking so it is very not good for many people because restaurant is public so smokers have to think many nonsmoker and also smoking is very not good for their health so they have to take the smoking so...
I think smoking should be banned in public or any places.  First of all, I think it's hurting everyone's health because cigarettes are bad for lungs, especially lungs and it's smokers' freedom to smoke but I think when you have the freedom you have the responsibility to take care of – to take care of others' rights so I think this shouldn't hurt other people's health while they are enjoying their freedom.  Second of all, I think the smokers are making streets very dirty because 70% of the smokers just threw their cigarettes out in the street.
I think there – there we need a specific and nice separate and screening spaces for smoking free zones and the smokers zone.  Two spaces have to be not evading each other and very separate – separated to – for nonsmokers – for nonsmokers or smokers and make campaign for smokers to slowly teach them how to...
As I already mentioned I disagree the opinion as smoking has to not completely be banded.  This is because smoking is kind of [***] to the smokers so there are several alternative ways to limited smoking.  For example government can make a safe place to smoke – towards smoking like they can make smoking booth or smoking area or some place and nonsmoker can – can come – nonsmoker...
The restaurant is the place for eating something so smoking in the restaurant is not good because there are many eat – eating people who wants to – who want to have a good condition of eating food inside so I think we have to restrict strongly smoking inside especially in the restaurant.  There are many kinds of people like young – young girls and boys and babies and even the old people and it's luck [***] – luck out of the – it's luck between inside and the outside so if the restaurant has not good – has not proper facilities to even like – or out...
I agree that smoking should be banned in the country and there are some reasons.  First of all, it is not good for health so with that said when father is smoking – when father smokes at home it has – it had bad effect on their wife or their children.  Even though people – if somebody isn't smoking is air around the people who are smoking they must had – they must have bad effect.  Secondly, I have a bad memory about smoking.  My brother smokes at home so whenever he smokes in the bathroom and if I use the bathroom I feel very bad about...
I disagree with banning smoking – banning smoking because we – we have to be – be – be sure of the freedom to smoke so for some people.  If we ban all the smoking many people will – will be – will be angry about the freedom – about their – their smoking.  So, we have to make some places for them to – to – to be sure of their freedom.  So, we have to make some smoking areas, all the – all the countries so it is not right to like ban all the smokings for the freedom of – of the like male – all the people so – umm – so we it is – it is...
I disagree with the statement.  Actually I think that government's ban on the smoke is not that make sense because that is kind of their labor and if their – their government ban on their smoke – smoking then they will – the smokers didn't stop their smoke and they will buy more higher price at the black market and also government lose their tax income so they need to – they need to find out other tax incomes to give their welfare services so – uhh – I don't think that government should declare [***] on smoking.
Smoking's really bad and even in restaurants it should be banned in two aspects.  First reason I strongly agree with the restriction on smoking in restaurant is that it will dis – it will disturb other people in the public location.  Since restaurant is often a [***] place it isn't only [***] for you.  It is often for everyone, every people who want to enjoy their meal and their cuisine so smoking will exert bad smell to that [***] good product to enjoy that.  Furthermore, smoking is [***] it is going to render bad effect and bad impact on other people even causing cancers and those things are reasons why I strongly agree for a wide ban...
Well, I think smoking should banned restaurants because well I have some reasons.  Firstly, the smoking is bad for people's well health so smoking is really bad for people's health so many people has been – has been dead every year so and also many people paid a lot of money by smoking because they must – they must go to the hospitals.  So, if the smoking should banned restaurants well many people can save their money because they don't have to go to the hospital so well they can – well they can pay – they can pay their money another place or buying another things so it is more productive and effective situation so...
I agree this topic because in world they have nonsmoking people so if someone is nonsmoking people they don't want to smoke – they want to – they don't want to smell the smoke and that smoke – smoke is very harmful and unhealthy so many people avoid smoking place so in restaurant or cafeteria they have – they must have – restaurant and cafeteria must have...
I agree with the idea that smoking should be banned completely in restaurants.  Smokers have a right to smoke but I think the nonsmokers' right also is important.  Nonsmokers will be very unhappy if they smell the smoking in restaurant and while they eat some food and for – because I don't think this should be – should – should ban because non smokers' happiness is important as smokers happiness and if they harm the – also they harm their health so I think this should be banned in restaurants.
I agree – I agree with this topic that smoking completely banned at all the restaurants and country because we have to protect our people's basic rights.  If – we – if smokers are smoking in the restaurants or the country the other people who – who is – who don't smoke they feel very bad so we said that if [***] they are not banned the smoking at all the restaurant so we can protect their basic rights and also indirect smoking is more bad so we think about that too and also smoking is – smoking is actually a bad thing so if we banned the smoking everywhere...
Well, in this case I also agreed that claim.  Actually I hate the smoke and the smell of the tobacco because the tobacco smell is so disgust.  When I was in personal computer station the – the station is full of smoke and the – so I have no choice to – to avoid the smoke and smells so I think that we have – we have...
