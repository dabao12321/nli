If our smoking in outside maybe a lot of people – another people in [***] involve our smoking smoke, maybe this is very dangerous in everyone health.  And they hurt too.

So, in my opinion smoking must not be banned in everywhere in restaurants or cafeteria.  I hate – I really hate smoking but I think when – when we ban smoking and everywhere smokers can – cannot smoke outside or something so they may – they have to smoke in their own homes so I think smokers will not – will not obey the rules and they may be smoking everywhere but when we – when we make smoking area they may go to smoking areas and smoke...

I think banning the – banning the smoking in the restaurant is not a good idea.  I hate smoking but I think smokers will – will not obey rules when we ban smoking everywhere so they may go well outside and smoke in the roads or – or go to – go to their homes and that – I think that might be more harmful for other people so when we separate the smokers' area in restaurants and allow them to smoke smokers will be more – more obeyful and smoke only in there, but when we ban smoking everywhere they may...
