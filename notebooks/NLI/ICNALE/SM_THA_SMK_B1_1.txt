Lunch will be – yes, it will be bad to – I think that the smoking is [***] whatever they can [***] or whatever they can [***], how many they can, you know, I – I see – I see many people that smoking, I think they look bad and [***] pollution, air pollution.  And air pollution that from the smoking I think it can cause the bad health too.  So it has a [***] something bad from the smoking.  It's not – it's not good I think, so that's the reason I think I disagree about that.  So – and I – and I heard that my father smoking to...

Yes, I agree with that.  I think – a – smoking in the restaurant should be banned because – a – lot of people don't – don't want to smoking.  So why – why people have to smoking in the restaurant because they have a lot of people that they [***] smoking, so they will get some – some smoke that they breathe, so maybe they can have disease in later, so why – why you have to hurt them by this way.  So if you want to – if you want to smoke, so you have to go outside, I think that's – that's good.  That's better for this solution.  So I agree with it.  If you want to smoke, so go outside and...

I think smoking is not good for our health and it make people unhealthy and like the people who smoke have the – will have many health problem and also – a – people around them who like smell the smoke from the smoking, they are also in dangerous because the smoke from the smoking is not good and like the secondhand smoking is will get more dangerous than the firsthand smo...

I think smoking should be banned because if you smoking, not only you that has the risk [***] to be like cancer or another disease, but people around you that has breathed that – that smoke – a – in the lung [***] like – a – they're – some – some of them, the – they're not – what you call, they're not health.  They're not have a good health.  And it's like you – hmm – not real surface but you also – you – you also like you – you damage another – other person health too, so I think the smoke should be banned.  In – in everywhere, not only just in the university...

I agree with this statement that many people hate the smoker because a smoke is that means they [***] smoke is smell.  Some day when I waiting for a bus, a smoker is stand too near me.  It take me.  I hate it.  They should go for smoking platform [***] place.  In my campus, many building provide smoking zone for a smoker.  It's good for them.  Many smoker can [***] for smoking because it can relax them for as a place.  They are [***] from [***] and they...

It – smoking is the bad – the bad way to – to [***] my – other people when I see the man smoking, I think it – it's not polite.  It can die to him.  I – I don't [***] it and I [***] more people allow [***] because smoke is bad.  It's not used for...

I disagree with it because I think smoking is not for everyone.  The providing of smoking area [***] the smoker and they will increase.  The smoking zone will help other people from damage of smoking.  But a smoke will damage themselves.  Smokers have died every years, but they smoke more and more.  My grandfather have died for cancer.  He is smoking every day.  He died in 1990 by cancer when he is 60 years old.  So I don't like a smoker.

No, I think it's the wrong thing in the restaurant because the [***] woke up your body.  If you can smoke, the children in restaurant, do you think it's good.  No.  You can't do it.  Toxic pollution will destroy your [***] system and [***] is bad.  Your country in Thai.

I agree that – a – because that have a toxin in [***] in smoking is now as [***].  Yes I agree and smoking in – in now – now – because [***] people smoking because they [***] smell, the bad smell and the smoking...

For about third question, I disagree to ban a tobacco or all of the smoke in – from Thailand, so – because every – every people have a freedom, so it is that depends on the need of people in fact – in fact a smoke is very not good for our – our organism or our lung, right.  But it depends on freedom because we – we have – we have a freedom to choose how can I – how can they can – can smoke, all right.  So if they smoke and they get a better job or get [***] they – it is [***] obey...

I agree in this statement, the smoking is so bad for the – for the [***] in – in – when – when – when you smoking, you have – really have to stop it in – in – in somewhere [***] that is [***] I have the people and – and – and I think we have to take [***] a lot of people in – in – in around yourself [***].

And for smoking, I'm agree to – to be ban in the country because smoking – I – I can find useful [***] for the smoking.  Enjoy, some – some people say they enjoy smoking, but enjoy what?  I – I didn't get it.  Smoking – uh – gives the smoker the bad thing – a lot of bad things.  It is may be main cause of the cancer – in the [***] abnormally – and – so it can be the smoke to damage the – the people around the smoker, so I – I...

I am not really agree with the topic because smoking – I will tell you what I'm not agree, but it will hurt government revenues as they make – a – the money by levying tax on cigarettes [***].  It is completely people's choice to smoke or not.  Cigarette is a type of drug, but it is up to them and what I – I feel that completely ban  about smoking is it can hurt people [***] disease like heart disease.  Sometime one cigarette doesn't kill one person...

I disagree about I – I agree about the smoking ban in restaurant because of people in the restaurant come to restaurant to eat, to dinner and they want a comfort situation then another reason is about smoking – smoking can make everybody around them uncomfortable for – for living or anything such as in the restaurant I want to have the comfortable situation for – for dinner with my girlfriend, yeah let's talk about the...
I think I agree with this statement.  I think smoking is very, very dangerous.  It can harm also people around you when you are smoking and it harm your – harm your health too.  In the pub – public place you shouldn't – should not smoking because you have to – have to – uh – be – have you shouldn't harm another – another people, and I think when you are smoking it shall be so rude, it's not proper in...
I am totally agree that if they – the smoking people should have completely ban to the restaurant, to the public place, to depart – department store, because the smoke that they let out from the smoking is very dangerous for other people like kids or maybe the place that they smoke may have a – an sick people in there that's not very good for their health condition, they might get worst from breathing the smoke that them let – that – that they let out.  The second smoke is no – for – uh – very dangerous, more dangerous the – than smoke itself.  I am the one who don't like to smell the smoke.  I think it's bad for your health and...
I think I agree with that, because the restaurant is the public place for everybody.  So, we shouldn't have a smoker to smoke in that area, because if you have – uh – smoke it will have many problems, such as you will destroy another person, another person is – will have – um – headache and sometimes we have a bad air for breathe and bad smell.  I think the restaurant is place of happiness, so it shouldn't have – uh – smoker for distorted bad feeling, so...
I agree with it to ban smoker in public area while you – uh – eat in – in restaurant and you feel smell from smoke – from smoker.  You will feel the food is not delicious and you'll feel sick – sick and headaches while you in – in my eye while you look at the place and look – look somewhat the movie – you'll feel from smoker – from smoker you will get air and do not take that content or topic from the movie then you'll have some part that means the smoker not – not bad – not bad but the problem is they – they don't smoke in smoking area and smoke in other area, so this are to quit people...
Um, I – I disagree with the topic that say – um – the smoker will – the smoker should be banned – should be completely banned from the country.  I think that if they follow the law in – in another – in – in the place that they smoke at that place then maybe can smoke.  Um, I mean that in some places they maybe have the law that – um – this place can't be smoking maybe – um –the – uh – let me see – the smoker will be follow the law and they...
Okay, I think [***] I made a wrong pipe, but now I know that your question is no smoking is [***] yes or no, I think I disagree about that.  I think that [***] is not best [***] smoking, someone – I have smoking, but [***] I think that because I should [***] every time, yeah and no smoking [***] I think [***] no, there is no way to [***] but yeah, when the way you [***] as much as exercise and sleep, get sleep, get some sleep there, get some sleep.  This will interrupt not the direct way to burn calorie, but it will make you fresh and have you some energy, give you some energy.

Yes, I agree with that because in the restaurant, they have a lot of people that they don't smoke cigarette.  So if you smoke in cigarette – if you smoke cigarette in the restaurant, other people that don't li – don't like the smoke and cigarette, they will have – have a [***] that so – it's not good for you and for them.  So if you want to smoke, you should go outside because some people – everyone, they don't like it, so you have to go outside for smoking.  Then if you finish your job, you come in the restaurant and go try [***] your – go and try your food again.  Yeah, so that's all.

The smoking should not be allowed in any country because the smoking is not good for our health.  It make – it makes our health unhealthy and like it's not good for firsthand smoking and also for the secondhand smoking.  The people around person who smoke and like actually people around them will get more dangerous than the people who – who smoke and I think it's – smoking should not be around – it should be prohibited because it's dangerous for everyone.

I think smoking is bad and it not only just for the – the people who smoke but the people surround [***] the smoker – the – like when you smoke, you just breathe up that smoke into your body, but other people that breathe it, they also breathe that smoke in their body and it can cause many problem like cancer and another disease.  So I think the smo –smoking should be banned, not just only in a public place, but I think everywhere people – people should – should the...

Nowaday, many people away from their health – they are smoking more and more.  I don't like cigarette, also [***] I don't like smokers.  [***] will help me from a smoke.  There are many people died because of cancer.  They did not smoking, but their friend or their family like it.  You can die from a cancer although you did not smoke.  However, I think smoking is not good for everyone, stop smoking is better.

Smoking is bad and who is smoking.  He and she is smoking because it's easily – it's bad and not – not good.  They cannot – cannot [***] shouldn't and smoke in area.  This people – this – this more people, but it have [***] to talk...

That I have said I think stop smoke is good for everyone.  Smoking area will support the smokers, but [***].  They smoke more and more.  They pay every day to buy a cigarette, but the government pay every day to treat them from a cancer.  I say to every day or every year.  So I think we must not commit smoking.  I think it can stop from a cancer too and stop damage to the smokers.  So...

No, I think it's wrong –uh – in restaurant, if you all can smoke in restaurant, do you think it's good.  And no, you can do it in – you can do it.  [***] a bad smell.  And in Thailand you can't do it – you – your – you can – you can smoke in restaurant in the bar and in the – in the – in the park and if – if you are do – you had no manner in Thai.

Yes, I agree people smoking not good, so myself and another – and smoking not for healthy everyone.  And smoking before and now, the life before smoking because they [***] is back and she would – should be – they – smoking [***] smoking people.

Okay continue, but when – when – whenever we [***] before [***] before you went there [***] –he is healthy –healthy body.  I think it is not necessary that they smoke, all right.  So in my personal – also in my personal opinion, I think smoke [***] better than smoke about [***] tobacco because of the – the medical property is a better.  When – when can get better jobs or can – they can hear about it some bad, right, to get – get our emotion better and then we can create something that is beautiful.  That's why I disagree about the smoke because the smoke is not limited for only tobacco, you can also [***] or can also the – the ha...

Smoking in the restaurant is so bad because restaurant gives [***] a good place for the – the other – other person the – other person, we don't know we will – we will – we will take care another person in his place because [***] when we have a dinner in the restaurant, this is good time.  We – who – who have to smoking don't...

I agree to be banned the smoking in the restaurant because smoke – smoking a cigarette, I could not find it useful or some benefit of it.  And smoking make the bad thing – a lot of bad things for the smoker such as cancer and – and it can be make the smoker's ba – breath ab – abnormal.  And then – and then – and then you get the bad thing for the people around the smoker, the damage [***] is it's like they smoke it by themselves, so I think it should be banned in...

I'm not agree to that topic at all.  I will tell you what I am not agree with that.  If people don't smoke in country, if your people – country won't make money.  If you want the smoker to buy another – some [***] addition which is – uhh – nothing, but drugs giving the [***] government money like I said in the first and what I agree with that is it affects the environment and also for government to spend a larger amount on medicine [***] about physical health problem, but also psychological [***] problem.  People...

I agree about smoking that ban in the restaurant because of the people come to restaurant to dinner they want the comfort sit position and comfort air because they want to have a good dinner so it means you ban the smoking in the restaurant.  Let's go to the bad thing about the smoking – smoking can make lung cancer a serious point or bad thing for smoking and actually then for them smoking in the restaurant because in the restaurant have many people such as the children so – so I don't...
I agree with this statement.  I think smoking is very, very harmful; it's so dangerous it can harm yourself and can harm the other around you when you smoke.  In the public place you shouldn't smoke, because when you smoke you can harm other people who should – who shouldn't be harmed.  When you smoke in the public place I think it's very, very rude.  You should smoke in your place, shouldn't harm other people.  Um...
I am totally agree that smoking people should be completely banned to the restaurant, to the public place, to the department store or even a government state.  I think smoke people should go smoke in the place that has managed to smoke.  In the restaurant it's not a really good pay – it's not appropriate to smoke in the restaurant because a lot of people come with their family to eat, to have their dinner, to have their meal – uh – if the smoke people smoke then there will be an air pollution for them.  Might – in the restaurant they even might have the sick people and the smoke is not really good for the health condition for them.  I think smoke people should know better and they should go to a proper place...
I agree – I agree with that, because restaurant is a public place, so it has many people in that place.  If we have a smoker smoke in the restaurant it will have many problem and it can annoy a lot of people, and sometimes we may – we have, uh, many problems, such as – uh –you smoke you will destroy a lot of people, and if you have bad smell and bad air for breathe.  I think the restaurant is the place of happiness for the family, friends, and another one.  So, it shouldn't have a smoke to destroy that feeling and I think the smoke...
I agree with it to ban a smoker who smoke in the mo – in public area, but the smoker who is not or not smoke in public area did not again if they impact smoke in smoking area, not smoke in public place.  When the people smell smoke fall sick or that they will – they will sick or have illness if – uh – either cause of cancer – of lung cancer – if you look back – if you look back – if you were treating from smoking, but and other one have that feeling from the smell of smoke.  I think it is – so I think smoking is bad for health.  It makes you have cancer and lung cancer you will make – uh – another people around your table...
I think that – um –the smoker will – will – will – uh – the smoker can be smoke in another place, which is the place that don't – don't have the law that can't be smoke in there.  I think the smoking is – it has a little bit benefit.  Um, but the smoke – but the smoking is – has affect in the – and the bigger – and the bigger one affect that I – that I heard before is – um – who is smoking there will be cancer.  I think that is a bad – bad thing.  Um, let me see; um, and this all is not – is...
