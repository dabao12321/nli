I definitely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  Umm – first of all, for customers in a restaurant, they want to enjoy the food and given that most people in the world aren't smokers, they want to enjoy their food without people smoking around them.  So, this is the primary reason.  And the second reason would be smoking is bad for people's health, essentially secondhand smoke.  So, people who smoke shouldn't smoke somewhere with people who don't want secondhand smoke as a matter of selfishness and being considerate.  And the third reason might be this would help get people's health better, so that the government has to spend...

Yes I think that smoking should be banned in restaurants because when we go to a restaurant to have dinner or lunch, we – we really would want some good time with our family or friends.  So, I think the – a person, a smoker smoking next to you would really spoil the mood, especially if you are a nonsmoker and you really hate the smell of the smoke.  So, I think it is very selfish of people, of smokers to smoke in restaurants or actually I think anywhere in the country because well, we all know that smoking has bad effects on our health and it is not only these bad effects, it is not only do, is not only affecting the smoker but also those around them by passive smoking.  So, it is actually very unfair for people next to them to suffer from these bad effects as well.

I agree that – with the statement that smoking should be completely banned in country and restaurants.  I will explain this from two perspectives.  From a perspective of the smoker, smoking is bad to the health and it may cause – it may cause lung cancer and certain chronic disease and it is certainly bad to our health.  Secondly, for – for the people, apart from smoker, if smoking is not banned, they have to breathe in smoke and they will have – and the secondhand smoke is also harmful to their health and therefore I think smoking should be banned completely in restaurant as well as the country.  And I don't – I don't smoking...

I agree that smoking should be banned at – in all restaurants.  First of all, it is bad for all people, not only the person who smoke but also others, having meals in the restaurants.  Restaurants are supposed to be the places where people to have their meals but not having to smoke around it.  But smoking is absolutely a bad habit that can cause several diseases and increase the possibility to have other diseases like cancer.  So, all people should not smoke.  It's not only...

Yeah, I am not sure that – if that you are saying about the ban on animal hunting.  I am not sure.  In short, I'll just say that this really – it depends on which animal you are going to hunt because I think animal is something very [***] animal is really harmful, then you can shoot them and I think that it is unnecessary to hunt them.  Secondly, it's about – about – it's about what is the use of the animal.  If they are the extinct animal, for example reindeer or penguin or dolphins, then I think there is a [***] to prohibit people from hunting.

I think that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because first of all, I think that smoking is a very unhealthy thing to do.  And if you don't ban smoking in all restaurants, maybe people will – like do whatever they want and just maybe they will pay for smoke – smoking and they will not only affect their own health, but also the health of other people in the same restaurant.  Although people may think that you can like divide the airway into a smoking area and a nonsmoking area, but sometimes it's very not strictly divided and it may cause some problems because the strictness and...

I think that smoking should not be completely banned.  Though we know that there are harmful effects of smoking and secondhand smoke will also – will also do harm to the other people but I think there is still the freedom for the smokers, just like while they are at home, we cannot completely ban their freedom to smoke.  And – but we may have some other suggestions to – to encourage them to quit smoking just like we can – the government can increase the – the price of the – umm – cigarettes and doing other supporting – supporting rules so that the smoker...

I don't think smoking should be banned in all restaurants all over the world.  Umm – because I think it is someone's right or freedom to smoke.  However, they need to be very careful that they are not violating others' rights and freedom.  Thereby I think restaurants should have outdoor area that allows smokers to smoke and will not disturb the other people inside of restaurant and I think not smoking should be a personal choice.  If there is a law to ban smoking, it won't stop it from happening, it will just make the people smoke privately...

I don't agree that smoking should be completely banned in a country because I think everyone has their own freedom to choose how to live their life and I think smoking is not as – as – as a serious problem as drug taking because smoking won't make someone cannot function well in terms of the physical and – and psychologically unlike drugs.  So, I don't – I think smoking is also a factor because one – after smoking one is still functioning and they can still think logically and yeah, so they are still conscious.  So, I think smoking is not necessarily be completely banned but we can do something to prevent...

These days some people say that smoking should be completely banned in a country.  To a larger extent, I cannot agree with this statement.  Umm – yes, smoking is not good for our health and will affect other people's health as well, but I don't see [***] in completely banning the – banning smoking.  First, I believe that smoking comparatively is less harmful to drugs and I think government should first effort to ban – to ban on drugs and then – and then comes to smoking later.  And second, I think it is a – it belongs to a certain extent of human right what regarding to smoking...

I don't agree with the notion that smoking should be completely banned because there are many harmful drawbacks [***] of smoking.  To – on a personal level smoking bring a lot of harmful effect to the body because it contains – contains a lot of carcinogens and it may discomfort, so it effects medically in one's health.  And in the family and society level, that – there are second smoke effect.  So, people – people who are nonsmokers would be affected by the first smokers because it's [***] created, so called the secondhand smoke would affect other people's health as well.  So, people would be negatively affected and at last there are newly published papers saying there are [***] the cigarette smoke that leads the [***] that would do...

I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants and also over the country.  This is because smoking is detrimental to both the smoker and the secondhand smoker.  This directly affects their health and smoking can induce tumors like pneumonic tumors – umm – for both smokers and the secondhand smokers.  And this will also affect the atmosphere and environment at restaurants when people are eating.  The smoke particle can attach to the food and customers even directly...

I agree with this statement because smoking is really bad for other health, truly not only the smoker because when secondhand smoke, people inhale the smoke from the cigarette and they get lung diseases and it's also others – people's right to not inhale secondhand smoke.  So that – so in a restaurant there are a lot of people enjoying their time dining there, they didn't choose to sit around with secondhand smoke.  So I guess we should also consider the rights of nonsmokers too.  So, I think that – well it should be banned and especially in these public places.  Nobody wants to be harmed even when they are enjoying their meals.  So, I don't think it's appropriate for them to inhale smoke...

I don't agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.  It is because for those heavy smoker that have been smoking for many years, it is really hard for them to quit this kind of daily practice and this kind of habit may not seem to be so healthy and is absolutely unhealthy of course, but then I think there should be rule for them to slowly quit them.  In order to really ban smoking I think the government should introduce more policies or even advertisements to help them to quit smoking with another means of health instead of really banning all the restaurants from having a smoking area or other means for them to continue...

Well, truly I don't I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all facilities in our country because smoking is actually your own choice of interest and even though it sometimes might be – when you are smoking, you are affecting others, and because the others might not want to take your secondhand smoke, but I think if you are banning all, banning smoking at all facilities, then you force the smokers to smoke on the streets which will further worsen the air – the pollution problem.  So, I think the solution is that maybe there are some facilities – in some facilities we can like allocate an indoor area for them – for the smokers to smoke and then – and then after that they have to – when they go into the shop, then they cannot smoke.  Also I think this...

I think smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants because as we all know smoking is harmful to our health and the – umm – the elements that contains in the cigarette is known to be – to be a cause for many health problems like lung cancer and I think the advantage of banning smoking in all restaurant is that people who do not smoke will not have to – umm – be affected by the secondhand smoke and even if there are smoking zone and nonsmoking zone, people who do not smoke will be affected by the smoke and...

I think I agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned because smoking definitely affects health a lot.  And in my point of view, smoking is kind of very selfish decision because the smoker will only think that because they – because he or she feels like to smoke, then they do not know that this decision they take – they made will be – will affect the others around him or her because when they smoke, the other people around them indeed – are indeed smoking as well because they are affected by the secondhand smoke or – in this [***] there is some other [***] just like second hand smoke...

There has been a lot of debate going on about whether smokers could smoke inside restaurants and – and lately in Hong Kong, the case is that such a practice is banned and I fully welcome that because I believe that people will have their right to smoke, but not, definitely not at the expense of infringing others right to health.  So, I think that is important that they respect others while they have the freedom to do so and things.  Umm – I think it's okay to smoke but if they are - [***] is to what one can do, so I do not support smoking inside restaurants.  But I do think people can understand that because...

I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in all country.  There are several reasons to support my stance.  The first one is that restaurants is actually for eating food and enjoying the meal but not a smoking lounge, right.  So, - umm – it is – so it is correct to ban all the smoking in different countries.  Some people, I mean some customers that – who are not smoking may think that it is very disturbing to have a smoker keep smoking around them and it is actually a very selfish action as well and the second reason is the secondhand smoke is actually very unhealthy especially to pregnant.  Some research says that secondhand smoke is actually more harmful than the first hand smoke and somebody maybe allergic to smoke and feel very...

I think this smoking activity should not be completely banned in all restaurants because for some of the restaurants for example like night clubs or bars or pop their customers are long-term smokers.  Most of the customers are long-term smokers and if smoking is prohibited in such kind of industry their profit will be extremely [***] and this will extremely effect the whole industry and although smoking is very unhealthy to both smokers and second hand smoke – smokers, however to industry like this we have to be more lenient and therefore the policy should be more flexible rather than being a one-off rule that will be applied on every restaurant.  To further extend I think the restaurants can divide into smoking area and non-smoking area to prevent complaints from...

Well physically from my point of view the smoking is certainly – certainly should be banned.  First of all smoking will do – will do harm to everyone's health.  It will not only harm the smoker's health, it will also get in the way of other people's health when even they do not smoke – do not smoking.  But, I have to confess it isn't an easy job for the every country to take efforts on banning all the smoking or cigarette smokers because we have to take the status quo into consideration.  Let's take China for example.  There will be over 200 million, which means 0.1 billion Chinese people that – that smoke.  If you want to ban all this smoking people and say you are illegal to smoke in China.  It will be really hard for...

Hello, my question is about whether smoking should be completely banned in restaurants or other public areas and my answer is definitely yes and further more important of all is about the health concern because smoking endangers both the smoker's health and also other's health.  For the smoker's health continuous smoking lot of smoking may lead to serious health illness or health prob – problems like heart disease or even cancers that is right now to because – right now all the medical technology is still a long treatment process and the second is about endangering others' health because smoking may have the secondhand smoke – cause of secondhand smoke which if the father smokes and his...

I think – ssh – smoking should be banned in public spec – places like restaurants, and this is because – uh – smoking is bad for people that – around the person who smokes, so I think that smoking should be banned because the person who smokes should be the one who really be responsible for the bad outcomes that smoking causes, but not those who are around the one who smokes.  And I support banning smoking, because it increases the – because smoking increases the risk of pollution and more importantly smoking also affects one's health and people – which – people who smoke are more likely to develop disease, such as lung cancer and lung cancer is mostly caused...
Um.  Basically, I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and in the country. First, let's talk about the restaurants, because when you are smoking you affect the people around you because – um – first – uh – it – the smell of smoke is really bad and it really affects – uh – it really affects one's appetite, and also – um – I think the phenomenon of second-hand smoking is – uh – quite – um – prevalent because you know the smoke goes in the air, and when people – um – absorb smoke they were like – just they are like smoking, so I think it is – uh – kind of unfair – unfair for people who – uh – do not attempt to smoke to have such a – a treatment or they have to suffer such a – um – a – a second-hand smoking...

Um.  I think – uh – just – uh – to ban smoking in our country is a good idea – um – because as everyone knows – um – smoking is bad for health – um – because – um – um – cigarettes – uh – it consists of many – uh – harmful ingredients which – for example, the nicotine – um – which will make – uh – peoples' get addicted to smoking, and smoking can enhance the chance of getting lung cancer and other kinds of respiratory disease. So, smoking – uh – generally speaking is harmful for humans, so I think that to ban smoking in our country is a good idea, but then I doubt whether this – uh – can be efficiently implemented in our country or not because – um – it seems like many people are nowadays – uh – smoking...

I don't think we should ban smoking in countries because – um – although smoking is bad for our health it is not as bad as – uh – like drugs or other illegal stuff, so that if you just – um – if you just ban it some people will think that – um – they are – like the level of seriousness is the same as other drugs, so they will still access it – so they may – um – choose to have drugs like weed instead of cigarettes because they think – um – I am doing something illegal anyway, so why not try something more exciting and this will lead to more serious drug abuse – abuse problems, and – um – yeah so – uh – I don't think we should ban it.  Um, we...
I definitely agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country.  First thing is that you want to eat comfortably in a restaurant, so that means without people smoking.  Of course, I am speaking from the perspective of the nonsmoker.  So, in a restaurant I would like to feel comfortable and to be able to enjoy my food.  So, people should not smoke in restaurants no matter they are indoors or outdoors.  Umm – and the second reason would be secondhand smoke is bad for people's health, to nonsmokers especially.  So, yeah, when I go to a restaurant, I don't want to – I don't want that thing to undermine my health and the third reason might be this can help reduce the number of people smoking in the whole country because if you don't...

Yes, I think that smoking is very selfish choice even though it's not just the restaurants, it's in the street, it's inevitable that people around you will have to smell, bad smells of smoke and also suffer from the detrimental effects of the smoke doing to our health, to our body, our lungs.  So, I think that it's very selfish of those to smoke, to effect those who does not want to be effected or who does not like it, who does not want it.  So, I think smokers are actually forcing people to do the same thing and worse still is that passive smoking is actually doing more harm to the body than active smoking, so it is – it just proves that it is even more selfish of smokers to smoke just because of their own – their own desire and they ignore...

I think that smoking should be completely banned in restaurants and I'll explain this from two perspectives.  From perspective of the smoker, they have the freedom to choose to smoke and I don't think they should have – they should have the opportunity to smoke in a restaurant because there are many people around them and people around them may breathe in the secondhand smoke – umm – unavoidably and this is harmful to their health and secondly – uhh – banning the smoking in restaurants is important because smoking is bad to our health and I think this can reduce the opportunity for smoker to smoke and indoor smoking is completely banned in a restaurant, I don't think that it is wrong...

I agree that smoking should be banded completely in all restaurants.  As smoking is absolutely is a bad habit that it's a long-term habit that can harm human beings health in certain ways.  In some cases, people would die because of smoking as it leads to different diseases and they – and smoking increases the possibility to have those diseases like cancer.  Especially in the case of restaurants, people are supposed to have meals but not – umm – not surrounded by people who smoke.  And therefore, I agree that smoking should be banned completely in all restaurants.

Yeah, maybe this time I have a rather different view because last time I think I had the one answer that [***] but I don't really understand the question, so I really cannot have to answer your question.  I don't know what is it you're talking about – yeah.  So I am so sorry that I cannot agree to answer [***].  I think I am totally misunderstanding it [***] so sorry.  Yeah.  When you say – [***] I am sorry but I think – something about [***] I am sorry [***].  So, I cannot have – maybe, I don't know the...

Yes, I agree that smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants in the country because I think that smoking is actually a very unhealthy activity.  It is not only unhealthy to the people who smoke themselves, but also unhealthy for the people who indirectly smoke because of the people around them are smoking.  So, if the smoking is not completely banned, there should be very much problem caused because, unhealthy [***] problem caused.  But the division, the dividing of smoking area and nonsmoking area is not very valid because sometimes it's not very strictly, so it's probably of no use.  And also ban this in all restaurants, all restaurants will probably help...

I think that smoking should not be completely banned in restaurants because the restaurants they are still different parts, so that smokers can be seated in a particular area, just like you sit in the outdoor area.  So that the nonsmokers will be less affected by the smokers.  And also if – if the smoking is completely banned, it may affect the amount of customers going to the restaurants, so I think it's better for the restaurant not to completely banned but restricting an area for the smokers, so that they can enjoy the meal and at the same time doing...

I don't think smoking should be banned in all restaurants or all over the world.  Umm – the most important thing in this issue is that smokers and nonsmokers should respect each other.  For example, when they are in a same restaurant, smokers should be considerate that their secondhand smoke will not bring negative effects to nonsmokers and bring unpleasant experience to the nonsmokers in the restaurant.  Therefore, they should go outdoor and smoke.  And at the same time, nonsmokers should understand that smokers need to smoke from time to time, so as long as they are not disturbing and yeah, they respect our interest – yeah, with the restaurant should make a place for the smokers to smoke.  And...

I don't agree that smoking should be completely banned in a country because I think smoking is not like drug abuse.  Umm – smoking is not as serious as drug abuse because after one smokes, one won't lose their mind, one won't lose control of their – of their – of their behavior or one won't – uh – lack the ability to function normally after smoking.  So, it is not very dangerous – umm – umm – it's harm is the harm to the smoker himself and maybe some people around him, but it's not very serious and I think everyone has their own lifestyle.  The freedom to choose whether to live healthily or unhealthy, so I don't think it should be completely banned.

I think smoker have the rights to – to smoke and it is – it has already set some [***] separate smoking area from nonsmoking area.  So, I think nonsmokers have the right to get rid of smokers, but smokers also have to right to smoke in restaurants.  Otherwise, the business of the restaurant would be affected as well as the smokers – smoker customers may not be happy about the – they will think they are discriminated.  So, I don't see a need for completely banning smoking in restaurants.  I think that a separation is – would – would – would be better than completely banning smoking.

Smoking should definitely be banned in restaurants because people go to the restaurant for food, but not secondhand smoke.  So for nonsmoker, smoking definitely bring adverse effect to them.  For smoker, one would say that it's kind of violating their right to smoke in the restaurant, but after balancing the opinion or the benefits from [***] I think smokers should really be banned smoking at the restaurants because it's – it's a social like public area that you have to respect each other and I think there are harmful effect [***] smoking should not be exaggerated or [***] to the other parties or to the innocent people, both nonsmoker in the restaurant.  That is why...

I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants in the country.  This is because smoking is detrimental to the health of the both the first hand and secondhand smokers.  The smoke particles may attach to the food which then the customers will ingest.  Then, this will directly affect – umm – the health of the customers.  Also, smoking can induce tumors for the first hand smokers and the secondhand smokers.  What is more, students may imitate the such behaviors and – and they acquire such bad habits when they are growing up...

I do – I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants because people don't want to inhale secondhand smoke during their dining experience.  Because secondhand smoke can be as harmful as first hand smoke.  I know that some people say that smokers have the right to smoke in public places, but I'd like to say that nonsmokers also have their rights to not inhale secondhand smoke from the cigarettes.  So, I think that overall smoking is not a healthy choice at all, so I guess that smokers should also consider quitting smoking, so that they could be more healthy because of not inhaling secondhand smoke and I guess people have the right not to be disturbed and be harmed even their dining in the restaurants.  So I think that it's appropriate to ban...

I don't agree with the statement that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants.  Smoking is obviously unhealthy for the health and other people around them.  But then, a fact should be acknowledged is that it is really hard for those heavy smokers who have been smoking for many, many years.  It's so hard for them to quit this habit.  So I think there are many other men for them to quit this habit instead of really banning that – banning smoking in every single restaurant.  I think that perhaps setting up of smoking area in restaurant that avoiding those second smokers who have has to be – are normal customers.

Well, I don't agree that smoking should be banned in all facilities in our country because I think smoking is actually a choice of interest and if all the facilities like ban the smokers to go in them, to smoke inside them, then it might even force the smokers to smoke on the street and even [***] will be – which will worsen the air quality and also I think if the facilities allow the smokers to smoke in the designated areas, then it's not that really affecting other shoppers or other facility users as smokers also has – she have the right to enjoy what they are doing and I think the only solution is that to make a compromise between the smokers and nonsmokers and that facilities...

I think smoking should be completely banned in all restaurants because smoking is known to be very harmful to our health and the – umm – the elements that contain in the cigarettes can cause a lot of health problems like cancer and I think banning smoking in restaurants can protect people who do not smoke from these very harmful effects and from the secondhand smoke and I think it may also encourage people who do smoke to quit – to quit smoking because they cannot smoke in the restaurants and it's quite troublesome for them to stop smoking when they are...

Yes I agree that smoking should be banned in the restaurants because smoking definitely affects – affects health and once – one smoke in the restaurant, the other will be affected by the one who is smoking as well because they directly inhale the smoke as well when one is smoking.  And – personal experience in Japan, once I sat down in a restaurant and then the res – the other one on – on the other table started to smoke, and this definitely affected a lot – affect my dining a lot and this made me a – dining in that particular restaurant a bad experience.  So, as a [***] people in customer in the restaurant, they should not smoke...

I think it's very important that people respect others and when it comes to smoking I think that – uhh – it's perfectly fine people who smoke but – umm – definitely not exp – at the expense of infringing others' rights to a healthy life.  So, I myself is – uhh – not a healthy person.  I – umm – I'm not extremely sensitive to poisonous gas and definitely cigarettes.  So, but that's not really emotional or personal.  I think for the – the greater good of the public it's important that people respect each other and while I do not believe that smoking itself is good, I think that people have their right to do whatever they want except that they – it doesn't – it shouldn't harm other people.

I agree that smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants in all country as mentioned before.  Restaurant is actually for eating food and enjoying the meal and restaurant is not a smoking lounge, right.  So, - umm –so smoking is actually very disturbing in the restaurant.  So, it should be banned.  The second reason is that the secondhand smoke is actually very unhealthy especially to pregnant or somebody who is actually not a smoker and I got – I mean I got [***] some smokers may think that restaurant is a place for them to relax and smoking help them relax too, so actually smoking in a restaurant is no big deal, but I think that it is a very selfish act as I mentioned before the secondhand smoke is actually very harmful to the people who were not smoking, so it is a very selfish act and I think...

I think smoking should not be completely banned in all restaurants although smoking is a little bit unhealthy for both smokers and second-handed smokers I think for some of industries for example night clubs, and bars, and pubs their customers are mostly long-term smokers and if smoking is prohibited in such kind of restaurants their profits will be extremely traumatized and that brings tremendous effect to the whole industry.  I think to further extend the restaurants should divide its area into smoking and nonsmoking area that gives customers choices to choose between sitting in a nonsmoking area or a smoking area.  This can prevent their complaints as well separating those smokers and nonsmokers and I think this policy should be more lenient and more flexible itself being in one-off rule that applied to all the restaurants...

Basically on my own point of view all this cigarette smokers should be – should be suggesting that they should not smoke in the public area.  On the one hand they are not only smoker that do harm to their own health, they will do harm to other people that do not smoke.  Uhh – but, we have to confess that it isn't an – an easy job for the country to legally ban all these cigarette smokers.  That means let's take China for example there will be – there will be approximately 0.1 billion people that smoke in China.  If you just want the country to make a policy that is stating that all these cigarette smoker will be illegal in public area.  It will be really hard for the government to implement this kind of policy and other and moreover all this kind of policy...

Continuing on the discussions about of course secondhand smoke may also cause problems that it is not the smoker's health, but also other's health that it may affect others' health like the Y generation and about the environment it also may cause pollution that at this time – uhh – earth, the air pollution is very serious and then the government should ban smoking in order to – as an effort to – uhh – cause or to stop serious air pollution and to stop perhaps some of the monopoly that is – uhh – unethical who – which – which profits from products from selling dangerous products that is...

I think smoking should be banned, because it is unhealthy.  First of all, it's unhealthy in a sense that it's bad for a person and also it's – it is bad for the environment.  It is bad for one person's – a person's health because it causes lung cancer which might even lead to death.  On the other hand, it's also bad for the have – environment because the smoke goes in the air and causes pollution, and one of the major causes of pollution is from the second-hand smoke.  So, I think smoking should be banned ultimately in order to preserve our health – of the people and as well as the health of our environment, and another argument that I support smoking should be banned is because...
So, as I have mentioned before I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants, because first it – um – it affects one's appetite, you know, when people are smoking around your – the smoke would choke you, and it affects your appetite, and also I think – um – because – uh – when you're – um – when you're in a restaurant you are forced to stay in your seat and when the people keep smoking around because the smoke – uh – basically goes around in the air, so you have no other method to avoid smoke, you know, you don't have anything to separate you from the smoke so you are like having a second-hand smoking, and I think it really affects one's health. So, I think it should really be – uh – banned in all restaurants in the country, so yeah basically I agree with the statement and...

Uh, to ban smoking in our country and also in the restaurant I think that – uh – that's an good idea, because maybe it's harmful to human bodies – um – some of the ingredients – uh – in cigarettes are actually very bad for health, for example like nicotines and tar – um – which would cause us – so you get addicted to smoking and also – um – those ingredients will increase the chance of getting lungs cancer or other kinds of respiratory diseases – um – so I think to ban smoking it's generally good for – uh – the public, um, but then I doubt the efficiency about implementing this – um – this issue because it seems that many people are now smoking at young age, so – um, they have been already addicted...
I don't think we should ban smoking, because although smoking is bad for our health it is not as bad as other drugs. If you ban it people will think that it's seriousness is – um – is just as same as with – and other things, and – um – you will not really stop them from smoking cigarettes because they are addicted to it and it's really hard to get rid of it, but they will find other substitutes and when they think that, oh I am doing something illegal anyway so why not try what – what will make me more excited, and this will lead to more serious drug abuse – um – so I don't think we should ban smoking which – maybe we should – um – try to invent some substitutes that will not cause – uh – bad effects like not as bad as cigarettes like – um – so maybe electronic cigarette...
