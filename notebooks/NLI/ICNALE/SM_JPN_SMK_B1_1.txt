I – I dis – I agree with the statement because firstly I don't like smoking.  Also, I think the restaurant is the place to eat, so if – if people want to smoke, they – they should go out – go out and smoke.  I think in the restaurant, there are many people and some of them don't like smoke – smoking.  People want to smoke should go out – should – should go out of the restaurant.  I think the banning the smoke...
I – I agree smoking should be banned all – all restaurants around the country because the many – there are many children at – at restaurant in the country.  Smoking is not unhealthy for them.  So I agree – I agree smoking is banned for – banned at all restaurant around the country.  I don't like smoking.  I don't like smoking people.  I don't – I don't want to go to smoking place, restaurants, smoking...


I agree with this statement because I think smoking is not good for people who smoke smokers and also the people who – who they are around smokers.  We – if we – we drink the smoke we have a cancer and it is too bad for our health.  We become weak – we can dead – we can be dead because of the smoking and I think people want to enjoy eating dinner or lunch.  But if they are smoker we can't and smoker we...




 
I think smoking has no advantages for society and health.  So, prohibiting smoke is – should be – should be banned by – again I agree with this idea of smoking is banned.  So, everyone should smoke in everywhere, but so everyone stop – stop smoke so in order to make better society.  So...




 
Restaurant is enjoy – enjoy eating – eating room.  So, want to smoking person and go to restaurant so they have to smoking with dinner or with or lunch.  So, we should – uhh – we should smoke in areas – smoking we should can smoke in restaurant.  So, maybe so [***] can't – don't smoking is very so...




 
I agree the idea that shortly smoking should be completely banned at all restaurants and country.  I have some reasons.  First, smoking is bad for our health especially for children.  It is very bad to smoke.  Also some people don't like smoking.  Second, not smoking can save money.  They can save money and use money for their hobby or leisure.  For these reasons I agree the idea that smoking should be completely banned at all...





I agree this opinion because if you smoke – if the smoke – if the smoke – smoking is bad not only for you but also for people around you and if you – and you – in addition smoking is bad for health.  Smoke and you spend – you will spend a lot of money smoking.  If smoking – smoking has no good point.  I think smoking is bad.





I – I don't like smoking and smoking in restaurant is selfish – selfish action I think, but I – I don't think smoking completely bad thing because smoking make – make people refresh and relaxing.  It is very good but...





I agree with this statement because smoking is not good for our health and we cannot escape from smoking people, especially we cannot feel by – especially if – if smoking allowed to – in social area, we cannot feel better so – and it is – smoking is very serious and – no, no – especially we cannot – and in restaurant we cannot feel delicious in and to eat and some food so we have to...





I agree with this – the topic because smoking does harm to don't – people who don't see – don't smoke like children and smoking if – when they smoke – smoke people who don't smoke feel bad.





I disagree this topic – the reason is two.  Firstly, the people who smoking – who smoke have right to smo – to smoke and secondly if – if completely banned the smoking, the government can't – can't have tax – smoking tax.  Smoking tax is – is very important on government's income.  If – if banned smoking tax completely government very – government have very problem, they – because I disagree this topic.





I don't – I disagree with this statement because the smokers have right that they smoke and sign [***] that smoke people are – are not smoke here – no, no, no, the sign that people here cannot smoke [***] for smoker.  So smoker take it for this sign – that sign but smokers can smoke.





I think smoking should be completely banned all – at all the restaurant because I hate smoke very much.  If there is a smoke, I can't enjoy the food at the res – at restaurant.  It is very disappointed and all people can't enjoy – can't enjoy themselves because they pay money for food they eat and smokers should be smoke for example at home if they want to smoke and restaurant there is a – at the restaurant, there is a smoke the food – the smoke make food...





I think we should ban tobacco because smoke – it is very bad for smoking people and no smoking people.  Smoking chain people receive – receive smoke and if they smoke tobacco, it is very harmful for their health like cancer.  So it is not – it is not good and no smoking people receive passive smoke.  It is very bad because they don't do anything, but they – they receive that smoke, it is not – it not good thing.  I – I think why the innocent people get harm by such smoking people's hobby.  So I think we should...





I agree this statement.  I have two reasons for this.  I will explain one by one.  Firstly, smoking is harmful to people in general, so – so smokers tend to get illness and so unfortunately in addition many people around the – around smokers will get – will get passive smoking and so they will get illness in spite of third person.  Secondly, some smokers smoke the cigarette with walking so fire on – fire on cigarette will touch...



I disagree with this opinion because we have a right to decide ourselves and smoking – and it includes smoking.  And for example - and - we have a right to smoking.  And – we – and I think we should not ban smoking.  For example, if some store separate from – and separate from smoking people and - so smoking people can smoke and non-smoking people don't – don't smell smoking.  It's no problem.  So that's why I disagree with this problem.

I disagree with this opinion.  That's because I think some people may dislike smoking but other people like smoking.  They have right to – they have a right to smoke.  I don't – I don't agree with smoke – smoker yeah.  I don't agree with smoke...

I disagree with this statement.  This is because our people have right.  People who don't like smoking have right and people don't – people like smoking have right.  We have to respect their right, their – their selves right, their right.  If you stop – if you want or if there is smoking at all restaurants people who like – who smoking the rights is – is banned.

I agree with this – with this statement because I have two reason.  One reason is restaurant is a – in restaurant many family uses the restaurant.  So the small children smoke – smoke the – near the – near the small children, smoking person is very bad for their – their health.  And second – second reason is the restaurant is a place where people should eat.  When eating many people can't – can't smoke.  So that's why the opinion is correct, I think.  Thank you.  That's all.  Good bye.

I agree because smoking is bad for human.  In my case, my father is heavy smoker.  Because – and my family is – is – is – is – my family find – feel – feel bad – feel bad to father's smoking.  Smoking is – is bad – is –is people – give people – give people feeling bad.

I think we should ban completely smoking because smoking seats can't shut that smoke of cigarette.  So the – the people who don't like it must be – must – must – so, people should stand it.  So we – so I think we should do it.

I think smoking is banned in restaurant because smoking is harm for not smokers.  And we – before eating something, our tongue is change.  Our – sorry, our tongue feel not at all feels appropriate – food, food.  So...

I disagreed with this idea because many people smoke today.  So, I think they can smoke in the restaurant, in the specific – in the specific seats in the restaurant.  Smoking is – smoking is only – only someone's – someone's hobby – hobby like thing.  So we can – we cannot ban, we cannot ban smoking, although smoking is bad for health.  So we should – we should take nonsmoking seats in the restaurant and smoking seats in the restaurants at the same time.  I think so, this is my opinion.

I – I agree with this opinion.  That is because smoke of tobacco is very harmful for us.  And smoke, smoke – smoke prevent us from eating meals deliciously – deliciously.  I – we can live without smoking.  So smokers – smokers can – can live without smoking too.

Smoking should be complete all restaurants – should be banned all the restaurants because smoking is hated by many people.  If someone smoking, someone is smoking, many people feel bad at the restaurant and they can't enjoy their eating with their family or with the – their friend.  So smoking is – smoking may – may – maybe – maybe hated.  Maybe, should be banned for all - in the all – at the all the restaurants.  Smoking is also bad for the – for their health.  So – so, also and the food – food is bad by smoking.

I disagree with this statements because smoking – because some people like smoking.  And if smoking is banned completely in restaurants they cannot rest in the restaurant by smoking.  And there is also – there is another – another way to smoking, to smoke.  And it is those who like smokes and don't like smokes...

Hello, I – I don't agree with idea but to ban – to ban smoking all – all the restaurant – at all restaurants in the country.  Actually – actually I don't like smoking.  I don't want – I don't want to get smoking – just I don't want to get smoke – I don't want smoke emitted – that emit – emit in smoking.  But the smoking is – smoking is the lifeline, so-called lifeline for – for the people who is smoking.

I agree with this opinion.  This is because smoker has right to smoke.  And restaurants, restaurants can get money from smoker.  If – if restaurant ban smokers at all, this means smokers – restaurants can get smoker's money.  However, smoker – restaurants should make efforts to apart smokers from nonsmokers.  Thank you.

I disagree with this statement.  This is a difficult question.  Of course, I hate smoking because this is so nasty and this is so dirty but every people have the right to anything.  Smoking – smoking people have the right to smoke surely.  This is because that I think that smoking area becomes smoke.  This is the best opinion for it.  I think this is my opinion for this question – problem.

I agree this statement because I think it is not good for – smoking is not good for other people.  Smoking is completely bad for our health and if people want to smoke they can smoke but smoking is bad for other people.  So someone smoke there, not only their – not only him or her but also other people smoke – smoking, other people same bad thing.  So I – I think this is good statement.

I am agree this statement because second-hand cigarette smokes is harm to humans, especially childrens.  If smoking is completely banned at every restaurants, it is very comfortable for us and we – we will - can enjoy eating at restaurants if smoking is banned completely.  Children can enjoy eating too and mothers with small childrens is very happy if smoking is banned at every restaurants.  So I think smoking is banned at every restaurant is good.

I disagree with this opinion because if we banned – if we completely, completely banned – banned, some people don't enjoy eating at restaurant.  So I think – I think smoking people and not smoking people is – should be separated.  Thank you.

I agree this statement because smoking is so bad for our health, not only who to – who smoke but who are near the smoking people.  I – I study this for the class in [***].  Smoking is not only the time smoke but in future will bad for your health.

I agree with this idea because I hate smoking and I think the smell of the cigarettes disturb the – disturb taste the food and maybe most of the people don't like smoking.  And – and smoking is not good for the health, not only the smoking people but also the other people, the near.  And I think restaurant can be get dirty.

Yeah, I am for this statement because I – I hate – I hate smoking and I think many people hate smoking.  So – so we should ban smoking at restaurant and – and smoking may – smoking is very bad for people and – and menu.

I don't agree with the – state – statement because I – the restaurant says don't smoke in my restaurant because the thing don't – the thing that don't smoke – don't smoke in – don't smoke here if – if the – don't – saying don't smoke – saying that don't smoke...





I think smoking should be completely banned in all the restaurants in the country.  There is – there are some reasons and I talk about some of them.  First, I hate smoke very much and I can't enjoy food if there is a smoke.  So, smokers should – shouldn't smoke at restaurants and I – I can't – I can't enjoy flavor of food if there is a smoke.  All people can enjoy themselves because they spent mon...





I think we should ban the tobacco because I have a one – one reason.  Smoker – smoker, if – if he – if – if smoker smokes tobacco, they – they –they – they – they – they – they – they give smokes to the innocent people that don't – don't smoke.  They are – they – innocent people are not do anything to do bad things so, but no smoking people receive the passive smoke.  It makes health – health...





I agree this statement.  I have two – three reasons.  I explain one by one.  Firstly, many people – sorry – but because – sorry – because smoker smoke cigarettes, many – many people around – around them have passive smoking and so they will get – they will get illness and in spite of third person, and secondly, in addition, smoke – the breath in – of smoker have harmful expe – ex...



I disagree with this problem.  This is – I have two reason; first one is we have a right to decide our-self, for example we have a right to drinking and we have a – of course we have a right to smoking and – so that's why I disagree with the problem.  Second one is that if restaurants separate the persons, we should not – no need – we have no need to worry.  So, for example some restaurants separate from smoking people and non-smoking people, and if we should do – we do that it's no problem; non –smoking people can smoke and non-smoking people does – non-smoking people don't smoke; don't smell smoke smell.  So, that's why I disagree with problem.

Hello.  I disagree with this statement because I don't like smoking but some of people – some people like smoking and they have a right to smoke.  So, I think it shouldn't be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country.  Restaurants should do – take smoke seat and don't – not smoking seat.  Smoke divide is important.  Thank you.

I disagree with this statement.  This is because I believe that you should separate the area of – which you can smoke and which you cannot smoke in the restaurant.  Everyone have rights.  People who don't want to smoke have the right of eating without smoking – smoke, and also people who want to smoke have right of like that who want – who eating with smoking.  If smoking is completely banned at all the restaurant, the rights of people who want – right of smoker is injured.

I agree this statement because I have two reasons.  One reason is on me, the smoker near my table I can't eat delicious food, and I pay the money to eat delicious food, but I can't delicious food at all I get angry and I think many people who – who can't smoke like me.  And second point is the restaurant is the place where the many family uses.  It means many children in – in restaurants, so the smoke is very dangerous for children's health, it's very important.  So, the – so the smoke is very dangerous for the people who are not smoking.  So, it should be banned I think so at all.

I agree because smoking gives people bad – smoking gives people bad feelings.  My father is very heavy smoker.  For – for my father's smoking my family feel bad – very, very, very, very, very bad.  According to – buying tobacco is very – very – very high price.  Buying tobacco is bad and people – and have...

I agree with this statement because we can't – we can't shut the – we – we – smoke – smoking is harmful for health of all people who is around the smokers which – but the smoker can't – can't shut that cigarette – they can't shut out the smoke of cigarette but – so we should completely ban smoking at restaurant being instantly [***], and smokers should be smoke out of the restaurant or they all leave.

I agree with this statement because the smoke is harm for not only smokers but also non-smokers, and there is much harm for pregnant women and – and when we eat something – before we eat something if we smoke the tongue will feel the changed taste of food, which we taste – the food tastes bad - worse when we smoke.

I disagree this idea.  My father is smoking every day, and when we go to restaurant – go to a restaurant in a family my father often use – my father often choose smoking seat, but he smokes when - after we all finish eating.  So, I and my mother don't – don't have a trouble with his smoking and when he don't smoke in the restaurant he choose non-smoking seat and – so he don't bother anyone around us.  So, I think this way is okay.  So, it's – because the restaurant have smoking seat and non-smoking seats, so I think the restaurants should – should not ban smoking and add...

I agree this opinion that is because smoke of tobacco is bad for our health.  Restaurant is the place to eating.   Smokers should not smoke, so that everyone can enjoy eating.  We can enjoy eating without smoking, so smokers can enjoy eating without smoking too.  If they want to smoke, they should go to another place to smoke in order to that everyone enjoy meals.

I agree with this statement because most people dislike smoke – smoking and they want to eat while there are – while there are fresh air, and if the restaurants banned smoking completely I think that more and more people will visit their restaurants, and it is good for restaurant.  Smoking is bad for health not only for smokers, but also for the people around the smokers.  So – so it is good for everyone to not smoking and if it – if restaurants ban at all – at all smoking it is good for society.

I disagree with this opinion because I think that restaurants have a way to divide the seats, namely make two kinds of seats for smokers and non-smokers.  Smoking – those who like smoker is – it is true that the number of smokers is small, but I think that the seats for them is not banned completely because restaurant is for rest.

I don't agree this idea to ban – to ban smoking at – at all restaurants in the country.  Actually, I don't like smoking and I don't want to – I don't want to get smoke – smoke emitted by smoking, but – but for the people – for the people who is smoking always – always smoking, smoking is lifeline.  So, smoking – so banning smoking at all the restaurants is poor.  So, I don't like – I don't like the idea to ban.

I disagree with this opinion.  This is – first this is because I think smokers have a right to smoke.  When they buy tobacco they paid tobacco tax, so they have a right to smoke.  In addition, if all the restaurants completely banned smoking at all, then I think all rest – all the restaurants will be lost profit from smoker.  Then, some of the restaurants may be – may be able – may not be able to remain.

I agree with this statement.  When I was a junior high school student, I went to the restaurant with my family for my birthday.  I could enjoy the time very much.  However, one person sit – sit – seated the next table to us, then he smoked the table.  I – I hate the smoking very much.  I feel so nasty, then I – I couldn't enjoy the time so much.  This is – I – I hated smoke and I hated – I became hate him; this is because that smoking should be completely banned at all the restaurants in the country – country.

I agree this statement – with this statement because I think smoking is bad for our health.  If someone smoke in public space, not only the person but also other people breathe the smoke.  It is not good for health, and maybe there are someone - someone and kids.  If kids breathe the smoke, their rise – raising is not good, and smoking is cause of some big – serious results, so other people who don't like smoking breathe the smoke is not good for us.

I agree this statement because restaurant banned – ban smoking completely – say - we can enjoy eating, especially young – young mother with small children and babies.  Smoking is bad thing for our health, so baby and children can't enjoy eating if there are people who is smoking.  I think if restaurants completely banned smoking restaurants change for good place for everyone and comfortable place for everyone.  So, I agree this statement.  I think this idea is very good for everyone.  We can enjoy eating food at restaurants.

Hello.  I disagree with this opinion because if we completely ban smoking in restaurant, and some people don't enjoy eating in restaurant.  So, I think the important – the important thing is separation, and so if we separate smoking people and not-smoking people, and both people enjoy eating I think.  Thank you.

I agree with this statement because I think smoking is so bad for our health.  I learned about this in college.  The smoking people is – will be suffered from smoke; after 20 or 30 years after.  So, I think smoking is – will give us bad thing, but never give us good thing for our health.  So, I think we should be completely – smoking should be completely banned at all restaurant in the country.

I think smoking should be completely banned at the restaurants because I think most of the people don't like eating in the smoking smell, and it's difficult to taste rightly, and I think and – smoking should be completely banned all the area because smoking is not good for the health, not only the smoking people but also the near people.  So, only electric cigarettes that never smokes should be used, and smoking is – well...

I agree with this statement.  That's because I hate – I hate smoking and I think many people hate smoking, so – that's because smoking – smoking cause bad flavor I think, and it – and it's flavor cause food at restaurant very – very bad, so – and so if – if many smoker are there I think food – food are not good, so – so I think smoking at restaurant must be banned.

I agree with this statement.  This is because smokers – smoking affect our health badly and smoker smoke – often smoke with walking.  I saw – I – I saw even smoker in – in the train.  It is very bad thing and smoker – many people – many people hate this smoke and we – we can't taste the dish with this smoke.  Our – our...
I agree because I don't like smell of smoking and smell of smoking disturb me from smell as the cooking.  I like cooking smell and smoking is a cost us – cost us much and I like smoking – breathing is hard by smoking and smoking changes our teeth brown color  and I want to – I want to enjoy the cooking without smoking.
I agree this – with this statement.  Smokers himself occurs this – this is very bad for their health.  Cigarette is harmful for human body for example lungs or throat and other functions.  Smokers around – people around smokers are unhealthy because smoke of cigarette observed from...
I disagree with this statement, no smoking at the restaurant because some people – for some people it is so important for smoking after lunch or dinner and with drinking.  But it is important to divide smoking people and not smoke people because smoke – smoke is bad for our health so not smoke people usually hate – usually or often hate smoke.  All people – all people become comfort it is important...
I agree with this statement.  We – we can't enjoy eating in the restaurant if we smoke.  Smoking makes our sense – our sense very much and we may absorb the smoke our – we may absorb smoke if we don't – don't smoke.  So in the – in the restaurant we should ban smoking, all the country.  This is my opinion.
I think I disagree with the statement.  I have two reasons to disagree.  Firstly, smoking may become a communication tool so in restaurant maybe some – some people who did not get – who did not friendly become friends maybe and secondly – secondly it is legal [***] so if they don't make trouble I think it's okay to smoking because of two reasons I disagree with the statement.  Yeah [***] smoking – smoking become refresh...
