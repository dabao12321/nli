I agree with this because – uhh – smoking is not good to our health or other people too, that will cause a pollution.  And this – uhh – is very dangerous too.  The peoples who breathe that in and the people who smoke it too, that is a lot of dis – disadvantages and there're no – there is no advantages for smoking.  And so I think the smoking is shouldn't be barred in other country or my country too – because the people will have more healthy without smoking.

I'm not sure about that.  I think smoking, it should be banned in the restaurant because it dangerous for the one who not smoke and it really more dangerous for the secondhand smoke, so I think the restaurant should have the place just like smoking area to make the one who want to smoke to [***] there, but you must make sure that the place you have – you make it to the smoking area is not near the one who not smoke to make them safe and not near the smoker.

For me I disagree with this topic because as everyone knows smoking has many disadvantage.  It destroy our body, our health, our lung and it can harm other people besides you if you smoke especially in the public place like a restaurant, running park, or a supermarket.  The public place has many people, many student and it will not okay if you will harm other people and it will be okay if they made some -- 
As for smoking if it should be completely banned?  I do not think it should be completely banned, even though it is bad for the health of the smoker and people around the smoker itself, but they are – sometimes it is something that makes people get into a group like social – like friends somehow have – a one way to connect by smoking with each other that might be weird but I think it's quite valid and happens every day when I – from my – uh.  And smoking, it's just – uh – bad for health but if – if people doesn't smoke all the time it – you might give something better but smoking – it – in the end it just has people to choose whether or not they want...
I agree with this because smoking is not good for our health and it will be caused the pollution, air pollution and it's very dangerous to our health or other people who breathe it in – it in and this is very bad thing.  And I think we shouldn't smoke or – or in any country, it shouldn't be evolved because it is no [***], but it is [***] so like this is dangerous to all body and it's – it's very bad for the health.

I'm not sure about that.  At first, I think smoking should be banned in the restaurant because of it's dangerous for the one who not smoke – not only the one, but also everyone.  But I think smoking shouldn't – shouldn't be completely banned just like in the restaurant, I think restaurant should have the place that the smoker have – can – the smoker can smoke well, but the restaurant must make sure that it's the – the place is safe and not near the one who not smoke to get them safe and not to...

For me I disagree  --  I  --  I agree with the topic because smoking has many, many disadvantage for our health because it destroy our body, our healthy, our lung and it may harm the people beside you if you smoke and especially in a public place like in restaurant, like in park or supermarket and because it has many people, many children and if you smoke there it will not harm people beside you too.  [***] many bad things happened.
Well, as for smoking it's quite bad for the health of the smoker and people around, so the good things that smoking does, but first let's talk about the bad things first; it's bad for health, it is on long last it could cause cancer, a lung cancer or many cancers because it's very bad for health but it's a long way, it takes many years before it gets that bad.  During the way that it gets bad there are some good parts as well like people connect each other by smoking or somehow people like believe in spiritual beliefs that smoking and like – it is a medium to connect with the afterlife or something or some spirits; calling or talking to them, that can be a good part, and we can...
