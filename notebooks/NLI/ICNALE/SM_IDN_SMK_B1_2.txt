Smoking in the restaurant is not good at all, because smoking in the restaurant will cause many harms for, not only the smokers itself, but also the people around the smokers.  Passive smokers is the one who kept the [***] and also the harmful impact of the smoking itself.  The smoke that comes from the cigarette can disturb many people, not only the smoker itself that having this kind of smoke, but also people around them.  And because smoking in the restaurant there will be lot of other people who is enjoying their meals and this is really not acceptable for people who cannot tolerate ash and also cannot tolerate smoke.  So, smoking in the restaurant is not acceptable at all in all kind of food and also the [***] not only for people that is smoking, but also the people...


And the third point is of course we have to ban the smoke, smoking from the public area like restaurant.  People have their own rights to – to – to inhale – inhale fresh air, not the smokes one, so it's really – a – a – the smokers is actually taking the rights of the healthy people or the passive smokers.  They – they become the passive smokers.  So it's – it's not really a – it's – it's not – if there is no benefits on it, so it's really – it's really – a – a – it's – it's – it's not good for the people and it's really – a – it's change the law of course - the law, the nature law because people have the – their own rights and the nature gives us a – a fresh air to breathe.  And in the restaurant, there is a – a – there is a bunch of crowd, so they may...


I'm agree that smoking should be completely banned, especially in a restaurant.  One cigarette contained about 7000 chemicals and it can damage the cell in the body.  And the greatest toxic from the cigarette come from its smoke because it contain a dangerous substance.  Then if they smoke in a restaurant, then the passive smoker will also get the effect of the smoke because it contain a dangerous substance, for example nicotine that can damage the brain cell, tar can kill the blood cell, carbon monoxide can make the very less of oxygen and carcinogen, it can stimulate the grow of cancer.  And if that – it can have lung cancer, heart attack, impotence - impotence and they can harm the baby if the woman is pregnant.


Um – I do not agree smoking was banned, I mean even they smoking in the res – restaurant, I – I don't mind if somebody smoking and well, I think it's their decision to do that and because those tobacco companies give the big taxes to this country, so that's why I do not agree of smoke – if smoking was banned.  And we cannot deny that smoker has a big donation or participation for this country as we know that tobacco companies like Djarum has a scholarship for those college student and that's why I do not agree.  And in fact I have lot of friend who are smoker, so it's okay for me if they're smoking in the restaurant.


I agree with the smoking habit ban in all restaurant and country because smoking habit will disturb the other people right.  Every people have the right to – to breath fresh air in everywhere they are, and if smoking habit is not banned in all country and restaurant, it will disturb the other people's right to get the breath clean air and everything like that.  And I think this would be effective if you are allowed this kind of topic to – to all the restaurant and countries because if you decrease the number of unhealth people that are caused by...


I agree with the topic and I've told cigarette – people say that - a cigarette company –paid very large number of money to our country for their company, but still the health of our society is more important than – a – money and – um – cigarette can cause – um – many health diseases of course and nowadays issue like global warming is also affected by smoke – a – so it will be better if the – if smoking is really banned from this country.


About this topic, I agree because smoking have – smoking has a very bad impact for our health.  I think smoking is detrimental, also it [***] for some illness.  If we care with our health, we have to stay away from smoking activity.  And in my country, the government should work hard to solve this problem, the smoking and the [***] in order to be equal.  Yeah, I think smoking is a very, very bad – very, very bad for our health, not also for our – our health, but also for people around us that – that – that – that – that breathe – that breathe – that breathe the smoke – that breathe the smoke.  Yeah, it's very – and have dangerous – dangerous for our health.


I disagree with smoking and smoking should be banned because smoking is dangerous.  It is bad for healthiness.  It will kill you slowly.  Why?  Because cigarette contains bad substances.  Smoking causes about 90% of lung cancers.  It also causes cancer in lip, jaw, liver, stomach and etcetera.  In men, smoking can cause impotence and affect the fertility of men and women.  It makes them difficult to have children.  I also agree that smoking affects in society, it pollutes the air.  Smoking affects others in the surrounding non-smoking community because second-hand smoke can also contribute to illness in people who didn't smoke.  And it's not good for the pregnancy women.


Smoking - smoking is not good for health and this can make some cancer – some disease like cancer, disease in [***] and it can reduce your brain.  It will cause - because of the caffeine and some additive things contain in this cigarette and this smoke will reduce your health - it can reduce your age and it cannot make - so it is not good for you so you cannot smoke.  But some people want to smoke in order to make – in order to make fresher and...


I personally disagreeing that  smoking should be banned  because I think smoking is – a – everyone's right and we can't prohibit everyone – everyone's right, and then if smoking is banned completely in our coutry, what will happen with the employee and cigarette and tobacco farmer.  We know that – we know that cigarette company also provides – also provides scholarship for many students with – it's so useful for our students educate, bigger opportunities at the school and get a better future.


All that I can say about smoking is not good for our lives.  Begins with the dangers, the harmful disease containing by smoking like cancer and impotence and also it's not good for our – for the pregnant mom and their babies of course.  And of course it contains toxins like nicotine – nicotine – nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide.  Yeah, I don't agree fully.  Okay.


I totally agree with it because there is no benefit with smoking.  Uh – if you really want to smoking – oh – please smoke – smoking in your own room, private room, personal room.  If they smoke by yourself, do not invite others to the - together with you because cigarette is like a poison.  Poison kill people.  It is better if you stop smoking, save your money by – I think it is...


Because the smoking is really bad for our health, so – a – we can smoke in restaurant if the restaurant that have that – a – have other to the smoker, but I think it is – it is more – it is better to – than the smokers to smoke in the restaurant because a nonsmoker can also get the disadvantages for – for – for this condition.  Smoking itself can be dangerous.  There're a lot of disadvantages like the disease that can threaten or hurt – a – for example in the [***] the brain system, cancer and – danger for our lung...


I agree if smoking must be banned because some of reasons.  First, smoking is dangerous.  In my opinion, not only active smokers will get effect from smoking, but also the passive smokers.  They can get lung cancer for] their lives.  The second reason is it is make the environment healthier than before if they're not – they're not smoking because – a – the pollution is less than before.  And the third, it will save your money and for example if someone spend their money for smoking, they can use it wisely to their saving and/or it will help to...


I agree that smoking shall be prohibited.  First, it can endanger – a – an active smoker.  It also be written in the cigarette package that smoking may cause us a lot of disease such as heart attack, lung cancer, impotence, and – a – a – pregnancy disorders, etcetera.  For example, my neighborhood, he is – he was [***] lung cancer because he – smoke about one or two pack of cigarette for 1 day.  Second, smoking also can endanger a passive smoker, for example a baby may get lung cancer after he – after he always inhale smoking from their father who is smoking.  And then smoking is also can endanger our environment.


Well, I agree that smoking is prohibited for us because of a reason.  The reason is that it can endanger both the active smoker and the passive smoker.  You know that the passive smokers are those who do not even smoke at all, but they have to be the victim of the active smoker.  And sometimes the active smoker do not realize that they can literally kill the passive smoker.  Well, for example, I have a friend of mine who actually do not smoke, but he has to be the victim of it.  He lived in an environment which is – which full of the smoker and one day, he didn't realize that his life is getting worse and he got a heart attack.  When he got to see the doctor, the doctor said – the doctor said that...


I do agree very much with that statement and I have some reasons for that.  First, it has so many impacts for your body and all of those impacts are bad.  You can get heart attack, lung disruption, or women can have problem to their pregnancy and so on.  Maybe smoking doesn't kill you at once, but it endanger your health very easily.  She said that she smokes two packs per day.  It means that [***] using your health [***].  It is really hard to understand why people keep smoking while they have been watching the effect of smoking itself.  Only self-awareness can stop addiction.

Second, smoking also can bother other people.  Passive smokers may have worse impact than active ones.  It is because they're breathing the cigarette smoke from many smokers who they met.  It becomes worse than that when that person has to do before.  Smoking is not advantageous, neither for active smokers nor passive ones.


I really disagree why we – we have to ban smoking because – um – when someone smoke – a – it is not always – a – harming somebody else because – um – and that – if we ban the smoking itself, we can harm the smoker – smoker's right.  Um – on the other hand, smoking can also – a – develop some nation's economical effect, for example it supports – it supports in money aspects – it supports in money aspects – a – a – such as scholarships and also – um – sponsorship – a – in the – some – um – badminton match and also in many thing else and if – and if we ban the smoking...


I strongly totally agree about the statement that smoking should be banned because – a – a – when we smoke we can – a – raise our chance to get lung cancer or mouth cancer and also it – a – can make a – a – people who have pregnant – is sick for a baby or a child – a – like my neighbor in my near house – a – she has a – her husband is a smoker, then she give birth to her baby, her baby is...


I really agree that smoking has to be abandoned in college and because smoking is really not good.  I think it is, you know, you smoking cigarette and because of the cigarette you can get heart attack and dysfunction of lung and it's very dangerous to wom – to women who is preg – who are pregnant.  And I really don't like smoker actually because – because of the smoke, okay.  I can't breathe freely and the smoke is really a smell that can – I got – I can...


As we know that the cigarette contains highly dangerous materials that use to make them, so smoking is - I disagree with that.  I am – I'm sorry.  I am agree with that that it must be banned everywhere because, yeah, the smokers – the smokers himself is so harsh to smoking everywhere and we – the – not do same thing, but we – we get the effects of the smoke, we get sick, we also get the – the lungs trouble, the cancer and every – every bad things that the non-smoker will get from the smoke.


So I can't really, really agree if as you are responding to question of all those as we want to smoke in the restaurant.  Well, people who have smoking in the restaurant even in the public area they are really annoying, because the smell of the smoke is really bad.  And it also has a bad image for body and environment for the smokers and the other people around the smoking person.  Even restaurant in the country completely banned, people just smoking.  This is really the good way to teach people who smoke to control their habit.  So, they will stand – understand that it's very impolite to smoke in the restaurant or public area.  And maybe obviously it can help them to not being so addicted with cigarette again and even decrease the number of smoking peoples and further...


Yeah, I strongly agree with that smoking is really disturbing me and also disturbing other people who – they not smoke and someone smoke only on [***] he will – it will be disturbing them.  And another reason is because smoking can have a bad effect for the smokers and also another people who're near them and health.  And also make the air become worse because it can be pollute the air and also it brings a lot of, what, pollution in air beside the...


I don't clearly hear the instruction, but I think smoking should be banned from the public, is that what you asked?  So, I'm going to explain why the smoke – why smoking should be banned from the – from the public.  Because smoking will ruin your health, for example, and smoking will give negative impact to another people and then – yeah, it definitely gives more negative impact to the passive smokers or you can say the people that is not smoking.  But if the smokers ne – are near to – are near to them, it will ruin their health more than the smokers.  So, yeah, I think smoking should be banned from the public.  But if you – if you want to smoke in a closed area, I think you could smoke inside the room.


Yeah, I agree that the restaurant should ban the – the bur – the smoking because it could affect the environment.  Not only environment, but it could only affect the people – a - it could distract the people around – around the person who is smoking because it – it could affect the health and a – the – the smoke – the white smo – the white – the white smoke that it produced, it could a – affect – a – persons – a person – a what – what – what's the word – a person concentration and it could – a – what – um – it could affect the whole situation if – a – a group of people – a – it could affect the whole situation if group of people – if a person is smoking – a – smoke – smoking and a – the – it could affect...


I disagree with that because not just because I hate smoke – I hate smoking and for health smoking too.  But I think smoking in public area is so disturbing people.  I don't like any smokes around me, also my friends, my family.  You know, smokes can – can – can cause some health disease like bad – bad effects for lungs, especially for your breathe.  I can't breathe with any smokes around me, so I hate smoking.  So, I – I would like to insult my friends if they are smoking in public places, this – this – what – what is it?  It's so disturb, so annoying for me, impolite – just impolite, the smoking in public places, because people around you can – we can – we...


Yeah, I am agree that smoking in the public it should be banned because it can interrupt our people's – other peoples and it can also impact to their health.  People who doesn't smoke, get a risk of people that smoke.  So, it – it – it's not – it's not fair.  People can smoke if alone, but they have to go to the smoking room.  So, it's not interrupting other peoples and it's not also make others people health become so risk.  And for me, I don't – I don't like to smoke because it is very dangerous for our health.  It can make our lungs more [***] and...it can also...


Well, I actually disagree with smoking should be banned in – in the country.  You know, it's – you know in – in Indonesia, it's – it's very – this is very – many people smoking.  I think the government or maybe, yeah, the government can make a – the rules.  Maybe, yeah, they – they can make some room or make some place for smoker and maybe they – they – they can make a rule to don't – don't smoking in – in the public area because it can annoy people.  So, I think that this could be – this could be a problem if – if Indonesia smoking the – should be banned in – in – in the country in Indonesia.  So, the...


I do agree because that's not really good for the passive smoker in the public area or even just one place that kind of - Indonesian government builded smoking area already because the habitual smoker in every corners of every city in Indonesia.  And I think if they are – they really care about everybody else or the passive smokers, they have to go to smoking area as well.  The habitual smoker should be more appreciate to make passive smoker and it will be – it wouldn't be harm to other one or the other person.


Smoke – smoke is the – a very bad thing for the nature or – or the people.  It has many effect and disease from – for her – him or herself or for the other people.  Smoke can cause many sick and makes discomfort in public with other people.  Other people who are not smoking feel like not comfort in the public with the – with smoke.  Also, the other people can get disease...


Okay.  I – I agree with – with the statement.  Smoking – smoking is bad.  It can make your body broke and not healthy – healthy enough.  Smoke is not – not bad for smokers but it's bad – bad too for the others person in this – in this – in – in near – near from here – near from the smokers.  It can make cancer and many more, and then I think smoke is stupid.  Why?  Yeah, because this is make our body...


I don't agree that smoking develop in a country, because smoking is a bad and it can – it can destroy your body.  Not only body but it can affect with another people that in run on to you – run on to you.  The smoke is really not comfortable for another people as well they breathe.  So smoking is really bad and I don – I don't like smoking and don't agree that smoking is developed in the country.  But some people say...


Smoking should not be banned completely, because this is – have a connection with our economical condition.  We know that some countries relies on the income from the cigarette company.  They can get a lot of tax from the company and – but if – or but if we just close the cigarette company because we know that this is very dangerous for our health, I think this is not a good decision.  We have to think about the income that we take from the tax.  How we can fulfill the tax, if we close all the cigarette companies.  We have to think about that I think.  And then when we talk about smoking, this is the right of every person to smoke.  But in this point, I want to focus on how to reject the...


Smoking – I do not agree with smoking if even – it is even prohibited in some countries.  Well, my statement is that smoking is dangerous.  The smoke itself from the cigarette is dangerous, even in cigarette packaging there are always warning, it's bad.  It can – it can result to cancer, heart disease, and disturbance in pregnancy for a pregnant wo – pregnant woman.  And the smoke can be for – hard for breathing.  I mean, as a human, you breathe then you breathe smoke from the cigarettes or people smoking, you get infected and that...


I disagree with statement, firstly, because it – smoking is a commercial.  The people that is smoking they want to calm the mind and they also want to find the information for smoking and besides puffing smoking is not something that bad [***], which we know that also has a bad heart.  So banning smoking will not completely bad this at all.  And second, the banning smoking will cause harm to – to cigarette company.  When people are banning smoking, it means that people will stop smoking.  So what happen to the – to those companies, because companies will not pro – produce cigarette anymore and it will cause the employees loss – lose their jobs and the cigarette companies have many contribution towards the city and towards the nation, especially in the tax payment [***].  So when the cig...


I do agree with the motion that – that we have to band the smoking, the smoke – the – the smokers from the country all of it, because the first ones are: it's such a waste of money for a person to buy a cigarette for smoking.  As we know that the economic – the Indonesian economic is – is – is not – is not as higher as the – the major country who is already develop ahead from us, because Indonesia is still a development country.  So – so, the people still – the – the income of the people is still under the average or in average.  So, it's – it's really a wa – such a waste of money.  And the second one, why you have to waste the money if you – if you are taking risk or you – you – you're risking your own health that's the – that's the second main point.  So – so you don't have...


I agree that smoking should be complete banned, because one cigarette contains about 7000 chemicals and it can damage the cell in the body.  The greatest toxic from the smoke just come from its smoke.  It contain of dangerous substance, such as nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, carci – and carcinogen, besides smoking can cause lung cancer, heart attack, impotence; and if the woman is pregnant, it can harm the baby.  Nicotine can damage the brain cell, the tar can kill the bl – blood cell, and carbon monoxide can make the body less of oxygen, while carcinogen can stimulate the growth of cancer.  That's why the smoke – smoking should be completely banned in...


Well, I did not agree if smoking would banned, because this tobacco companies is a big taxes to this country and I don't mind if somebody is smoking as long as they are not smoking near me.  I think it's their decision do that and we cannot deny that smoker has a big participation.  I mean big donation for this country, as like tobacco companies, like Djarum has a foundation and has a program like scholarship for those college students, and I think it's really helping for this country.  And – and the most taxes to this country are donated by tobacco companies of course and in – and, in fact, I have a lot of friend who...


I really agree with that topic about ban smoking in all the restaurants in country, because smoking habit is really harmful for – either for – for the passive smoker and – and active smokers.  Smoking habit bring a lot of harm; for example, when the passive people inhale the smoke, it contains a lot of poison in that smoke and it will harm their health too.  And for the active smoker, there ha – the smoke is – the cigarette it has a lot of – a lot of nicotine and tar that makes their body bad.  A lot of act...


Yes, I agree with the topic, because I think smoking is really bad for our health, even for – even if we smoke just for a little bit, the smoke is still in our lungs.  It remains in our lungs and the smoke itself contains a lot of dangerous chemicals that even humans cannot – cannot get rid of it.  So – so, yeah, it is a very – it is very true, very a positive way to banned smoking from our country and although they said that smoking – smoke cigarette – I mean cigarette company has...


I have got this topic ban all smoking.  I think I agree, because smoking has many bad impact for our health.  I think smoking is the main or the main of the cause of the death for some illness is it can ruin our health.  We have to stay away from smoking activities.  And government in my country should work hard to solve this problem between smoking and the society prosperity in order to be equal.  I think smoking is very bad for – for our health.  So not – not for our health but people around us, means if any – it cause passive smoker it has the very bad, bad impact – impact for – from...


I disagree with smoking and I think smoking should be banned, because smoking is dangerous.  It is so bad for healthy.  It will kill yourself, why, because cigarette contains of substances.  Smoking causes about 90% of lung cancers.  It also causes cancer in lips, throat, liver, stomach and etcetera.  Even smoking can cause impotence and affect the fertility of men and women.  It makes them difficult to have children.  Also, smoking affects society.  It follows the [***] smoking affects others in the surrounding who do not smoking or the people in non-smoking communities, because secondhand smoke can also contribute to illness and people will be...


Smoking is bad for our health it's because some additives can – things contained on the cigarette.  It can make cancer some disease and it also can cause death.  It will reduce your age and it can make you look older than ex – and in exactly.  And this is bad for your health som – and some people loves in smoking, because they – they think that smoking can make them more relaxed and more fresh and more enjoyed.  But this is not true, because it can make you feel bad and we can – sometimes you can feel confused and it makes you – and it can make an addiction to you so you cannot stop smoke.  If you try to smoke, you cannot stop from it.


Speech part 2 [***]: I disagreeing that the smoking should be completely banned as in our country, because from the cigarette company itself we get many advantages.  And we know that many cigarette company give a scholarship which is good for students.  It helps many students to get extra [***] opportunities – opportunity to school and get a better future.  The other reason is we know the cigarette company also provide job for many employee.  When smoking completely banned, that will hap – happen with the employee and the tobacco farmers, they will have no job anymore.


Well, I don't agree with this – with the – with smoke of course, beside it's not good for our health because of the chemicals contained in there, like nicotine, tar, carbon monoxides and – and others.  Well, and it also – it – it's not good for our – and it – ours – what is it?  For people around I sit also can causes – can cause cancer and impotence, and heart attack as well, and it's not good for a pregnant mom.


Smoking didn't totally agree with it, because there is no benefit that you can get when you smoking.  Cigarette is like a poison, cancer poison, stroke poison, heart – heart attack poison and death poison.  And smoking in public is like force people around you to eat that poison together with you.  Actually, you force the other people to eat more poison than you, because passive – passive smoker get more risk than active, the smoker.


I'll agree that the smoke – smoking should be banned, because smoking is really bad product for our health.  There are a lot of disadvantages that decreasing our health through the month, through [***] the more than the smoke is dangerous for the smoker and the non-smoker who near the smoker.  The smoke can be dangerous, because the ingredients is – is not have for our – for our body.  The – the ingredients are: first is nicotine, this material can make people addic – addict and also broken the brain system; second is tar, this material can be dangerous for our lung, because tar can kill the cell in the blood system; third is carbon monoxide, it is – it can destroy – destruct the oxygen to enter our body; the four is carci – carcinogen, carcinogen can make a cancer to our body.


I agree if smoking must be banned, because of some reasons.  First, I think smoking is dangerous.  It will affected not only active smokers but also passive smokers and for active smokers they can get lung cancer for their life and for passive smokers it will be harmful if they – they're near the smokers.  And the second reason, it will make the environment healthier than before, because the pollution is less than before.  And the third reason, it will save your money.  For example, someone everyday he smoke or he smokes and he spend...


I agree that smoking should be prohibited.  First, it can endanger smoker.  It also written in the cigarette packet that smoking may cause some side – or a lot of disease, such as heart – heart attack, lung cancer, impotence and pregnancy disturbance.  I know, but the saddest thing is someone who was addict with cigarette cannot or difficult to stop their – their – their habit to smoking.  Second, it can also endanger the passive smoker.  A baby who often inhale a smoke from their father may have a lung disease and also smoking can...


Well, I agree that people – that smoking is prohibited for us, because of a reason.  The – the reason is that it can endanger both the active smoker and the passive smoker at the same time, because the passive smokers are those who do not even smoke at all but they have to be the victim of the active smoker.  And actually sometimes the active smoker don't – do not realize that they can literally kill the – the passive smoker.  For example, I have a friend of mine who do not even smoke at all, but he has to – he has to be the victim of it, because they – because he lives in an environment that full of the smokers.  And one day, he got – he got an heart...


I do agree very much to that statement and I have some reasons for that.  First, it has so many impacts for your body and all of those impacts are bad.  You can get heart attack, lung destruction, or women can have problem to their pregnancy and so on.  Maybe smoking didn't kill you at once, but it endanger your health seriously.  To say that you smoke two packs per day, it means that you have been reducing your health time remained.  It is really hard to understand why people keep smoking while they have been watching the effects of smoking itself.  Only self-awareness can stop addiction.  And second, smoking also can bother other people.  Passive smokers may have worse impact than active ones.  It is because they breathe in the cigarette smokes from many smokers that may add [***].  It becomes worse than – than that when that person has disease people.  Smoking – smoking...


I disagree that we should banned smoke and it is because, first, it harms the human rights, and the second is because everybody has – has their own choice.  Let's say, for example, in – in the – in the public places, if we banned smoking in public places, many smokers should, but the – the – the second – the second – the second reason is because smoking can develop some nations in – in economical aspect, it can im – improve a...


I strongly agree about the statement that smoking should be banned, because for active smokers it can make – it can be fatal for their health as because smoke can – because smoke – smoking is very dangerous, can make their cancer and cough maybe.  And also smoking can harm for passive smokers like people who – who don't smoke, but they – they – they...


A – I really agree that smoking in a restaurant should be – a – a – should be prohibited because it can disturb anyone who is having - a - dinner in the restaurant because smoke from the smoker is really bad.  A – it can – it's not healthy because we can't breathe freely and I personally doesn't like smoker because every time smoker smokes cigarette near me, I can't – I can't breathe freely in really – really – in my...


Smoking is highly dangerous, so, yeah, I'm agree with the statement that it must be banned everywhere, not in terms of only in restaurants because mostly in the restaurant, there is a smoking room, but no, I'm – I disagree with that.  I think the smoking room must be banned too.  And the smokers must be – must be gone like a – like vanish from the world.  It makes bad effects for health and for nonsmokers.  They will be died slowly if they get that habit.  So you have to – a – vanish that – that habit from the beginning, from the smoker's [***].  Yeah.  The restaurant too must – must have a regulations, stricter regulation about the smokers.


Well, I completely agree if every restaurant in the country not allow everyone to smoke in the restaurant.  Well, people who are smoking in the restaurant even in the public area, they're really annoying because the smell of the smokers are really bad.  And maybe it also has a bad damage for body and environment.  If every restaurant in the country comes to ban people to smoking, this will be a good way to teach the people who smoke to control their bad habit, so they will understand that it isn't really polite to smoking in the restaurant or public area and maybe honestly it can help them to not being so addicted with cigarette again and even decrease the numbers of smoking people because smoking is really a bad habit, but it's very addicted for everyone that has – that already tried...


I strongly agree with that because – the reason is it can be worse for the air and also the person because it can ruin the person and also ruin – a - other people's health and it – it is not good at all and you – you [***] you spend money to buy a cigarette and you burn – burn it.  It's same like you burn money and you know it – it is so [***] money to another thing that more important than smoking or buy a cigarette.  Maybe you can spend...


I still doesn't hear the instruction clearly, but if I'm not wrong, I hear restaurant – if it is restaurant, then – yeah, I think they should ban smoking from the restaurant because – it's - it's not only the smokers that visit the restaurant, right?  There are also other people, the nonsmokers – a – yeah, I think they should not – they shouldn't have smoke in – in front of another people at the restaurant.  Yeah, they should ban smoke – smoking in a public and at the restaurant.  If you want to smoke, go to the smoking area where the government provides.


Yeah, I agree that the restaurant should ban the – the bur – the smoking because it could affect the environment.  Not only environment, but it could only affect the people – a - it could distract the people around – around the person who is smoking because it – it could affect the health and a – the – the smoke – the white smo – the white – the white smoke that it produced, it could a – affect – a – persons – a person – a what – what – what's the word – a person concentration and it could – a – what – um – it could affect the whole situation if – a – a group of people – a – it could affect the whole situation if group of people – if a person is smoking – a – smoke – smoking and a – the – it could affect...


Well, I disagree with that, because in restaurants, there is –there is some restriction especially, not smoking, because restaurants are also public areas.  Everyone is eating there, so it's so impolite if you're smoking around them.  The smoke is so annoying for them.  They are eating and you're just smoking.  The smoke – the – the smoke can cause people hard to breathe.  It has bad effect – bad effect too like disturb – disturb your lungs, it can – it can – like – like bad for your health, your breath, for your lungs especially.  I think it's not good to smoking in – in public areas especially in the restaurant.  I hate smoking and so do my family, so...


Yeah, smoking in a restaurant, it should be banned because you're – you're interrupting other people's – other people's comfortable that want to enjoy their foods.  And smoking itself is very, very dangerous to our health, that's why people will die from smoking.  It can get the impact from the people that smoking near them, so that's why people that want to smoke, they have to go to the smoking room, not in the public [***] that cigarette of that smoke itself, it's very dangerous for our lungs.  And people who – who doesn't smoke can get the impact when the people that smoke near them too.


Yeah, I – I disagree with smoking which should be banned in – in the country.  You know that's – in – there is – in my country, there are so many people smoking.  I think there is – there is solution for government to make – to make a deal with –um - smokers in – in – in – in the country.  Yeah, as – as I said before, um – you know, the government can make rules be - make a place for smoker and the – the place for smoker and so – so the smoker cannot be smoking in the public area.  That's very important for smokers because you know, in my country, there're so many – there're so many – there're so many smokers, so that it's – it's going to be problem if Indonesia is...


I do agree – um – I think smoking banned in restaurant on other public places – um – because that's not really good for the passive smoker in the public place or even at restaurant only and the Indonesian government builded smoking area already for the habitual smoker in every corners of every city in Indonesia.  And I think if the habitual smoker really care about everybody else about – um – the passive smoker, they have to go to smoking area as well.  The habitual smokers will be more appreciate or respect to the passive smoker when they weren't smoking in a public area.  It wouldn't be harmed to...


Yes, the decision [***] is smoke can – um – spend off your money.  It's – in Indonesia, it costs around 10,000 rupiah and we did one like that, we can get [***] spend on smoke – also smoke are not giving as something that – a – has an advantage for our body.  It's just [***] destroying your – our body.  Smoke must be...


Okay, smoking is not good for us, but why?  Many people smoke and loved it – love it.  I don't know.  I think in my country, Indonesia, smoke is like habitual and must.  Every – every people, women or men like smoke, but yeah, I don't – I don't know.  Now there is [***] smoke, but I think it's bad smoke too [***] smoke and smoke is not good for our health.  Smoke – smoke is...


I don't agree with – with this statement or I disagree with this statement because as I know smoking is really bad for body, not only for body, but for another people around us who you [***], it's very bad in your body, especially in your lungs and for another people surrounding you it's really not comfortable while they take a breath and you are smoking in the next to her or his and really - it's really not good for health and...


Smoking in the restaurant is very dangerous, for example, if you are not a smoker and you have to prevent the smoke of the cigarettes, this is the important – this is so dangerous because this – this can – it can give negative effect for your lungs.  It can make you suffer lung cancer, but I can say that we cannot just completely ban the smoking habit because this is the right of every people, so I recommend you to just treat the smoker by giving a special room for – for example like smoking area, so they can get their right and we cannot get the negative effect of the smoking habit.  I think this is fair enough for the two parties because not every people is a smoker.  We have to be saved from the smoke.


Smoking in the restaurants, I do not agree with smoking in the restaurant because it's disturbing other people who enjoying their meal at the restaurant.  You don't want if you're eating, - um – getting infected by smoke of the cigarettes, so I think the restaurant should prepare special place for smokers where – where that place is only for smokers for – for smoking and then they can smoke there without having trouble by getting complain by other people where they smoke and – where they smoke at the restaurant and that way people will enjoy their meal more.  Hello?
