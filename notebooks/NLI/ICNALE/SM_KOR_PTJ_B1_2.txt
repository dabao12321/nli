I agree that college student do the part-time job because we need to more information from the experience, so we happy to do the part-time job.  We have more experience – we get more experience.  So I think that we need to more part-time job at college student, that's why I think that we have to more part-time job to run more part-time job.

Yes, I agree to that.  We must do work for money because our life of student are use a lot of money, so we always want and must do part-time job.  I already have – I already had a lot of part-time job, and in that time I am very busy because I have to study and work together.  But – uh – if...

I think part-time job is important for university student because, of course, studying is also important, and also study their– about their major is also very, very important.  So, if they only – if they only try to study their university study or their university major, they don't have a chance to experience real society, so they experience the real society from the part-time job, so I think part-time job is very important, and part-time job is good experience for us, so I think part-time job is...

I mean, okay, the part-time job is also important, but I think the more important thing when you are in the college, the study would be more important than working, so money is that...

I disagree with this statement because if parents could give them pocket money, you should not – you don't have to have part-time job.  If you have money but you have a part-time job, maybe you just waste your time.  So if you have money, I think you don't have to work so much.  But if you have – if you don't have enough money, I think it would be better to have a part-time job so then you can have your life better.  And if you have a girlfriend, you should – I think it would be better to have a part-time job because...

I hope that part-time work is very important.  Many students and young people maintain their livelihood by working part-time.  In particular, students will buy things, then it is by working part-time, or often pay for their meals if the house is also not leased.  You have to earn their own tuition.  Student do not have a lot of ways to make money except their part-time work.  Part-time work is considered an important part – part of many student.

I don't think most of college student have to – have to work part-time job, uh – but you know they cannot afford to study without part-time job – I used to work part-time job too.  If I don't work part-time job and I am very – have to go to school and study, so it's a bitter pill to swallow so I – I – I hope a lot of students don't have to work part-time job.  But, actually – actually many – um – many college student – students work part-time job – um...
I actually agree with the statement that university students needs to do the part-time job, not because of the money because of the experience.  I actually finished serving my country, I mean I went to the army so I felt that people without any part-time job experience have some  --  have  --  have something really lack of doing social things and people who have the experience of part-time job have more confidence doing some work with other people.

I think part-time job is important part to university student, so I agree this topic.  Naturally, almost every time they spend their own time in university to study their own major like that, so they can't have many chance to experience real society.  But so doing part-time job, they can experience their society, and also they can earn their pocket money themselves, so I think through the part-time job they can experience their society, and also they can reduce their parent's burden because they can earn their pocket money themselves.  So, part-time job is...

Part-time job is not important to university or college students because student is study hard and make money.  During make money and studying hard is very – very, very – very hard.  Only studying their major is very – is very hard.

It is – it is – I think I am very, very lucky [***] man because I am... while I am doing part-time job, I experienced many things and I learned many thing.

I think having a part-time job – having a part-time job to university student is not a necessary thing for them because it can prevent studying their major and they can go – it can – it can – it can be like the point, so I think part-time job is not very good for university student, is not the – if the job is not related to their major.

Hello.  I think that part-time work is very important.  Many students – many students and young people maintain their livelihood by working part-time.  In particular, students will buy things they need by working part-time, or often pay for their meals, if the house is also not leased.  You have to earn the – their own tuition.  Students do not have a lot of ways to make money except that part-time work.  Part-time work is considered an important part of many students.  Part-time work is also an integral part of stores [***] for price [***].  They can be used a cheap labor of course, if labor is expensive to maintain our store.  Stores cannot generate a lot of interest, thus part-time works is necessary part of our rates.

In my opinion, when I am university under the [***] for my future study, so I have – I don't have time to do part-time job, which is the reason I disagree with the statement.

I agree to this statement because I am a student and I am adult.  I think every adult have to make own their money because students – even though university students are adult, and I think adults have to make their own money, not – not to give their – give money from their father and mother.  Now I work in my university and I – I – so I – I usually – my – I spend money – I earn – own my money and I usually spend money with cosmetics, books, or present to my friends.
