In my personal opinion, part-time job is very important thing that – in poor student, because student can – can earn money by themselves, and then they have – if they have a money, they don't need to provi – provide – they don't need to help from their parents.  The reasons are, if they want to buy some books or books, copy or food, they can buy themselves, and then they – they can take practice this job before they get a real – their regular job, so I think they needed – they needed to get a job such as part-time job, that's why I think about that.

I think to work – and to work – and to earn the money – uhh – [***] – uhh – it's really important thing I think.  This experience make – uhh – people think a lot and deeply, so it is important thing I think – uhh.  To live a better life, I think it's – it's very important to experience a lot.  So, part-time job is so really good experience.  I think college student need part-time job.

I agree with this statement.  When it comes to a part-time job, I think it is essential to student.  We can't [***] diversify ourselves life from a part-time job and meet several people who have different personality.  And it can't be given a lot of advices from people who have a lot of experience thereof.  As a result, we can make dream comes true, maybe by a little [***], and we will make – we will be able to find several reason with large stories.  Up to now I said why it is important and why I agree with this situation – statement.

I think the student have to – have to be very tough because today the cost of university is expensive, so parents – it is too difficult to pay the cost of university.  So the student have to part-time job, and because the student is not child, they are adult, so they should help to pay the cost of university to help their parents.

Yes, I agree with the part-time job.  Student must need the part-time job, I am agree to that topic.  So, they have not – they have not much money, so launching and – so – work, and they – and they – their need – something to meet, so I agree the part-time job is must needing that – uhh – part-time job is – that's all I know.

It can be a cha – time [***] by himself or herself is very important too.  They can schedule their own schedule and they can [***] for their – for their life.  It can their [***] being on the field is very different from learning on the school.  Being on the field maybe different but it's important to learn the things in the field.  It's important for them, because they can prepare it for their – uh – career and it's important to be in the field and take...
Um – the second – and second in my opinion are by doing the part-time job I can – I can earn my own money – own money, so after that I can be more independent from my – from my parents and my parents also feel proud of me and I also – I also have a – I als – I also have my – my self-esteem – self-esteem grow – grow more and more and I can be proud of me by – by earning my – my own pocket money.  So, I agree with the part-time job and the – and the third – and the third I feel that the part-time job makes – the part-time job.
I agree that it is important for college student to have part-time job, becau – the reason why I think about it – uh – is if we don't do the part-time job we may have trouble in the future, because when I – um – when we were in high school we couldn't give [***] the opportunity to have part-time job so we don't everything in the social – society, and if we have the part-time job we prepare the future and we – uh – we know what I want and what I like and what...

Also part-time job will be good for your society life.  You can experience – uh – what you can have the job it's hard.  So, I agree with the part-time job.
