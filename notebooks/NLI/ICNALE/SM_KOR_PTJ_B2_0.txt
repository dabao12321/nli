I agree to the statement.  Students can do part-time job.  There are few reasons why I think this way.  Firstly, students can be a batch of people, so it is good experience.  Secondly, students learn to understand each other.  Lastly, students can learn about teamwork, so it is helpful to student to other things.  It is good to student.  So I agree to that statement, students can do part-time job.

I totally agree with having a part-time job to earn the money for the registration fees and the cost of living.  It will make them have tuition [***] manner and strategic plan for their own life.  But the problem I think is it has opposite sides that can make students [***] to flip during their class, and therefore to get that – that lifestyle.  In conclusion, working part-time job is a good and proud habit, but on the other hand, students should be careful not to have bad lifestyle due to hard work.

In my case, I really agree with that opinion.  I think it is very important to get or to do a part-time job to university student like me.  I am 23 years old, and before I am a university student, I already started to do the part-time job.  You know there is a time we can grow up and we can meet a lot of people, so we can improve our communication skills or service minds, I think, and it will be a great experience or to getting a job.  And, you know, we can earn money by ourselves, so we can know money is very special and we can know my family finding my mom and dad mine, so I think it will be very helpful to me, and to my friend also...

I agree to that speech which is talking about – hmm – college students have to experience part-time job because – uhh – nowadays in Korea without – without part-time experience, we can't have opportunity to work in full-time.  Basically, to the part-time experience, they can understand that industry and company culture and task...

It's important to get part-time job for university students because it's too expensive.  A crisis [***] of things or – and tuition for university, so especially for me, I am from another region of Korea, so I want to get another part-time job with my study.  And without any job it's too hard in living in Seoul, so now I am getting my money from my parents, but it's too heavy for my...

I agree that college students should have a part-time job – for one – first of all, part-time job experience will help you – will help you have a social experience before you have a real job.  We can – we can make many friends through that experience.  For example, my friend have a part-time job, he is currently working at a restaurant.  He made a lot of friends, and there he said that he – he learned a lot about the socie – how the society works.  For second – second reason that I agree with this statement is that earning money is also good for college students because...

I think it is important to student to have a part-time – part-time job because they can earn money and they can have – ah – experience of – ah – job – ah, ah, umm – but I think it is hard to study, but even though – uhh – student need money to study, so they – uhh – it is important that they have a part-time job – ah, ah, uhh, ah – and it is – ah...

I think part-time job is very important for university student.  The reason why I think like that is that it helps university student to make money, and also prepare for the – his job.  For example, when you do part-time job, you can get money, so you can earn your tuitions and other – other fees for your entertainment, and also you can prepare for your future job by doing part-time job.  For example, when you do – in the finance company, when you part-time job, you can get to know whether you are suitable for the finance job or not...

I think – I think it isn't important to have part-time job for college student because – ah – student season is very important time in – in people's life.  But if they spend their time by working as a part-timer, it's not good.  I think instead of working, studying or doing activity with their friends or traveling, or getting certificates is better job, I think.  Only student can experience many things in society, so – or working...

There are several reasons to support my opinions.  First, as a student, people could not have a lot of money to buy books or clothes they want, but if we have a part-time job then you can earn lot of money and you can buy anything you want.  And also – uhh – I think it is great to have, ah, experience before the work.  And if we have a part-time job experience, it will very helpful your future job, and also you can have – umm – you can treat a lot of burden things, so I think it is really great to the future job.  And also you can learn how to comm...

I agree this statement.  First reason I agree this opinion, we can learn about the society while we do part-time job.  And second reason I agree to this opinion is we can earn money to spend life in college, so we – we – uh –we can – we can start our college life more happily, and we can enjoy our college life.

I agree with the statement that part-time job – it is good to have a part-time job for student because there is two reasons.  Um – first reason is that to have a part-time job is a good chance to learn social experience, and for example, if student do the internship for a 6 months or 1 year, they can learn about the official environment, and think that they will need future.  Also, when they do a part-time job, they can get allowance by themselves, and so they don't need to...

I think it is up to student because I –  I have a idea that part-time job is – has many good points such as, you can earn your own money by yourself, and also you can prepare your fee for the university, so you can – you don't have to be helped by your parents.  But in the case of me, I have my parents apply the fee for the university, so I don't have to feel any necessity to do the part-time job.  But I have experience doing part-time job, and I served many advantages such as...

I agree with the statement [***].  I think nowadays students should have – should have part-time job because I think they should earn the money or their pocket money, and they should have grow their society ability, and so I think doing part-time job when you are – when you are students, doing part-time job is good for you.  When we do our part-time job, we can have a lot of experience and knowledge without study, so I think doing part-time job is very important.

I agree with the topic about part-time job for university students.  Because it is good experience for the people who got part-time job because, for example, I was experienced about the catering service, and I knew about the thing that the people, or what – or people do something for the – uhh – job about catering and I – I do something – I did something about [***] things like – and it was good experience because I met a lot of people, and they were so gold to me.  And sometimes...

Nowadays, the tuition in most university course getting is – are getting crazy and more high.  So, I think it is hurting for most parent – parents to pay for it.  So I think college students have to do part-time job because it helps them to become independent, and they can build up how going where the society is, and I think it is also good for them to get to know economic concept, simple [***] my experience, I have be...

I think the part-time job is question on integral part to the students.  Poor students usually earn living costs by working part-time.  Tuition, housing cost, living standards and many parts can be served to do a part-time job.  In addition, it gives [***].  They earn their own money, and then money will be freely available.  They can buy a friend's gift – it is also able to present to their parents.  This can be a clear advantage, but it can be a disadvantage.  Student can waste time by a part-time job if need to concentrate on study.  This is an important issue in society, so students need ability to adopt the working hours and hours of study.  In conclusion, I think the part-time job is a necessary event.  It is definitely fact, part-time job...

Uh – in this topic I partly disagree about – about it.  Um – part-time job – doing part-time job has both good part and bad part, I – but I think bad part is more.  In good part you can earn money and also experience – working ex – working condition in whe – what – what you're doing, and also you might meet someone when you are doing a job and can – you can make friendly relationship with – with someone.  But I think bad part is you – you are losing many times for studying.  Doing part-time job means you have – uh...
I don't think it is important for college students to experience part-time job.  The first reason is that the college students should focus on their studies.  Uh – it is the time for them to search what they are going to do after they graduated from university, and I think it is not – uh – good idea to focus on irrelevant issues.  Uh – second reason is that I heard – uh – my friends talking about part-time jobs; they told me that it was not worth it and they should have done – they should have – uh – spend time on doing other things, you know, the important things like studying and searching for their career, so...
Uh – given the long-term visions, because school activities during the semester is not enough to – given them in assignments [***] – assignments [***] them in each course, so college students should work part-time during the school year is not only – [***] can be counterproductive than non-students who work part-time.  This – this reason is why I disagree about – uh – part-time jobs for college student is not that important during the semester, yes.  So, again I disagree college stu – children [***] do the part-time job during the semester.
I agree, because – um – well experience can help students to get a real job, I mean, they will know what they are good at or not good at – um – and what they really want to be.  Also, they can realize how to save money and use money, because they know it is hard to earn more than they use money.  So, I think it is important to – uh – have a part-time job for students.
I think it is not vital, but it is kind of important for college students to take a part-time job and work as hard as they can, and then the [***] they want because after the graduation they might – they might find it hard to find a job that they really want to do.  So, having a part-time job would be a great experience and a great booster for them to work hard, study hard, and find who they really are and I believe it has – um – grown – it helped me grow in person and in...
I agree that – uh – part-time job for college student is very useful for them [***].  There are several reasons to support my idea – um–.  First, it can give many experience for college students – um – in my case I – I had coffee – I have part-time job doing coffee shop and restaurant, I could meet many people, and I could –uh – experience many variety of task [***], for example serving for many customers and meeting many people so I can – so...
Um – I disagree with the college students working for the part-time job.  First of all, I think it will disturb our studying because – uh – you don't have much time to study because if we study for like 5 hours then we can't get used to go school stuff, and second of all I think it's better to have better grades than working for like few dollars.  Nowadays, in Korea I heard only 5000 something want you get...
Uh – I think part-time job for college students it's not – um – thing that's really needed to the students.  Studying – studying on their – on their major [***] school con [***] keep learning about what they really like is more important than the – than earning monies for their hobbies of or eating food or their school monies, but by people who have lack of money to go to college or university – uh – that student might have – might can have part...
I agree with – that college students have to – uh – have to part-time job.  There are several reasons why I – uh – agree with this opinion; first of all they can learn social experience before they graduating [***] the day.  Uh – by working – uh – in part-time job they can learn how to communicate with other people, and – um – learn – uh – value of money, and they can – uh – they can – they can independent from their parents.
I think we should – we college students have to have a part-time job, because it's kind of opportunity for – uh – gaining – earning money in the early period – early time of future worker.  So, if – uh – it's good opportunity to gain the money for tuition fee, and even we can use the money for shopping our personal need, and it's experience as well.  So – um – it can be a good experience for preparing the job in the future, and that it can grow our personal independent...
Uh – I agree that it is important for students to – uh – do a part-time job and there are some reasons.  First of all, they can build up their experience before they start their job in the future – uh – uh – through their part-time jobs they'll meet many people who can help for their future, so they can build up their network and they can learn how to communicate with others.  Also, I – once I had a part-time job before which was very helpful for me.  Secondly, I can get some part-time – I can get some money from part-time job.  Um – since my parents don't give me money I have to make my own allowance...
I agree because – um – doing a part-time job can be helpful for many reasons.  Uh – first be – ow [***] we can learn – um – some talking skills, – um – use – using some techniques when we – uh – spoke to customers – um – during the part-time job we learn about how to speak – uh – carefully and kindly to customers and using that – using those we can – um – use it to our friends or parents or other people, and second it is – we can be some – be help to parents because we earn some money.  Um – we don't have to rely on parents and...
I disagree with that statement, because students – uh – job is to do their best of their studies, so if they are attracted – if they – uh – start a part-time job I think they don't have enough time to – uh – study.  So, – uh – if it is possible I think that – uh – they concentrate of their studies the best way, and – and then they will be able to receive scholarships from the university, and then I think that is the best way to get money comparing that doing a part-time job when they are students.
I think having a part-time job as a college student we produce two good effects.  First one is you will be really good at your time management skill hence if you ha – in the case when you have a part-time job you gotta need to reschedule your time and – suppose to have – make your schedule more efficient which means that you will be good at managing your time than when you do not have the part-time job.  Furthermore part-time job will provide much opportunity for you to feel how the society works and how the real society is if you take one more step to follow your future career.  So, for those people I think having a part-time job – uh– really good for college students.
Well, I agree with this statement – well – and I have some reasons.  Well, the firstly – well students can earn – uh – earn some money.  In these days well due to the poor economy there are many students including myself have a – have a – have poor – have a tight budget, so we need to save our money wherever – uh – can.  We all know that money is indispensable in everyday life, so without money there are lot of limitations, and also well – and so the – having a part-time job – having a part-time job is good for our budget, and also well the students can broaden their horizon by meeting different people at the part-time job, so well it is good for their career and some personal social skills.
I agree with this topic, because I think it is very helpful for future job.  Part-time job gives also experience I think.  They suffer [***] hard time and how difficult I earn others money and in that time will children saving money, and income and outcome, and I think -- 
I disagree that col...college student should have a part-time job, because I think the most important thing for student to do is to study it – his major and having a – uh – part-time job will spend time, so he'll – student do not have enough time for his study.  He – it – so he cannot con...concentrate on this study, so it is not good to have a part-time job.  If he doesn't have enough money to pay to school then maybe he should have a part-time job but if not then I don't think he should have a part-time job.  Uh — and also having a part-time job...
I disagree about that or this topic that college students have to study – uh – college students have to do part-time job, because I have a two reasons to – I disagree about this topic.  First one is they have to study because college students have many things to do study, so – uh – if they do part-time – part-time job they have – uh – little or they have time – very little time to study, so – so it is bad, and second reason is I think college student have many – have to experience many things like – or even if – uh – do the part-time job – uh – we can get experience like through that job...
Uh – I agree with that, because – uh – actually I have a partenta [***] – part-time job.  Uh – uh – the part-time job – uh – that is not part-time job – um – I teach students in middle school.  In – in that – uh – because I have – I need money to buy clothes and my – um – college books for study, and date – or dating, so college student have to – must have a part-time job, because they need to be – uh – independent.
I agree to the statement.  Student can – student have part-time job.  There are few reasons why I think this way.  Firstly, student can meet many people, so they – they can – their membership.  Secondly – uhh – they can – part-time job is good experience, so – so I agree to the statement, student have part-time job.

In addition to what I said – and before – and previous question, working a part-time job has another good side that is they can make students prepare for their career to work better in the new condition or new environment, in the new company.  And it will make them have lots of qualified and – qualified and – they will work very hard to get their...

Yes, I agree with the statement.  Part-time job is really important to some people like me, I mean, the university students.  When I work at Japanese restaurant Mitsuwa, I could improve my communication skills with customers, and I could have the customer service mind.  And when I work at the school for teaching children English – I could learn patience to waiting for their reaction, for their understanding, as in it may be very helpful and it may be a great experience, people will start to real get a job.  And very good experience.  And still I am working at the educational center as a part-time job.  So I can earn money...

I agree to that topic which is talking about college student's part-time opportunities and experience.  At first, in Korea, nowadays, without part-time experience, students can't have the opportunity to work in full time, and that opportunity can help the student have great experience, and they can perform more.

Umm – I think it's important to get a part-time job for university students because it's – it's too expensive prices of things and tuitions for university, so especially for me, I am from another part of Korea, so I – I am getting my money from – only from my parents, so it's hard to earn money for me, for my parents, so – umm – it's too hard living in Seoul without any help from myself, so it's important to get part-time job for university students.  And so on– uhh – because I...

I agree with the statement that college students should have a part-time job because first of all college students can have social experience before they have real job.  For example, my friend who is currently working at a restaurant, he said to me that he learned a lot to – to work – the experience of working there.  He made a lot of friend and he learned about how the society works.  For the sec – and secondly, I think that college student – it is good to earn money when you are in college because you need a lot of money to support yourself to – you – you – you don't have to rely entirely on your parents if you have a part-time...

It is important to – uhh – it is important to have a part-time job to – uhh – to student.  They can make money to part-time job.  Uhh – it is important because – uhh – uhh – uhh – it is important because they need money to study – uhh – for example, most university student need money for study, or – or they use the money without study just for using their...

Uhh – as I told you before, I think, when you do part-time job, it is good for you to get to know whether you are suitable for your part-time job.  For example, when you work in the marketing company as part-time job, you can get to know whether you are suitable for marketing job or not.  And also you can get money by doing part-time job, so I think there are many positive things when you do part-time job, so I think part-time – doing part-time job is very important for university student.  Also, when you do part-time job, you can – you can get to know how your boss run the business, and this is good for you to know how you organize and how you run the...

It isn't important to have part-time job for college students because student can experience many activities in society instead of working as a part-timer.  Working part – part – working is – I think working is not good time to way [***] how to [***] because only university student, college student can experience many things and many opportunity to do, so I think they have – I think it's better to study or experience other things in their college.  They might...

There are several reasons to support my opinion.  First, as a student, people do not have a lot of money to buy – to buy some books or clothes they want.  If you have work or do a part-time job, then you can earn some money, so students can buy what they want.  And second – and you can have various experience before getting a job.  And doing a part-time job, you can meet a lot of people, and a lot of the senior or supervisors, so we can learn how to – how to communicate with other people like elderly or younger people.  So it is really useful before getting a job.  And...

I admit this statement obviously.  First reason I agree this opinion is we can learn about social – social life while we do part-time job.  And the second reason I agree is we can earn – earn money to spend life in college, so we can enjoy and enjoy our university life more [***], and we challenge more...

I agree with the statement that it is – uh – it is good – it is a – uhh – it is a good thing to have a part-time job for students because it is a good chance to learn about social experience for students.  For example, if student do the internship for 6 months or 1 year, and they can learn about the social experience and the task that they will do in the future.  Also, students can get their allowance by themselves, so they can need to get their allowance from their parent.  Hmm.  To experience...

As I said, there are many advantages to do the part-time jobs such as – and I felt that – uhh – to keep in touch with people, and how to handle the people, many kinds of know that many – there are many kinds of people in the world, and they are all different, so I thought it is difficult to handle many kinds of people, and we have to think about other people's mind [***] and that's what I serve the most.  And also the money is important thing.  Usually, university students do the part-time job because...

Aah – I think nowadays student should have a part-time job because they can – they can grow – grow the society abilities and they can – they can have – they can have a lot of – a lot experience and knowledge without studying, so I think nowadays student should have part-time job because – because they should earn money for – for their pocket money, and we should – uhh – we can't – we – we should depended – independent from the parents, so – so I think doing part-time job is good for – good for them.  And – uhh – we can...

I agree to the part-time job for the university students because it can be – uhh – it could be a great experience for the – for people who got part-time job, and we have knowledge only to do something for many, and part-time job could be – can meet – can meet some – a lot of people, and it can be a great experience for the people who has not experience about leading some another people because it is good to know about how to – how to treat somebody, and – and a point of view...

In my opinion, I couldn't agree with – agree more with that topic because in nowadays the tuition in most university is getting high, and it goes crazy.  And the most student in Korea rarely do a part-time job, they just want to – want their parents to pay for it.  So I don't think it is a good way to – for them to be independent.  From my experience, I have – I have been doing a part-time job for – and I usually pay for my tuition by myself without my parents help.  I think it is – could...

I think the part-time work is considered an integral part of students.  Poor students usually earn living costs by working part-time.  Tuition, housing cost, living expenses and many part can be served for part-time job.  In addition, it gives them self-reliance until all money; their money will be freely available.  They can buy a friend's gift.  It is also able to present their parents.  This can be a clear advantage, but it can be a disadvantage.  Student can waste time by a part-time job.  He will need to concentrate on studying.  This is an important issue in society because students need the ability to adjust the working hours and hours of study.  In conclusion, I think the part-time job is not necessary...

You start – you can lose time for studying, because you – you're not doing – you – you – you get tired because of your part-time job and you can get less grade I think, and someone say it is very important to do part-time job but I don't think it's not necessary because in my case I – I did military service on my duty and I learned something very – very much.  I – I learned – uh – restrict [***] relationship with my – uh – with my – uh...
I think it is – uh – important for college students to experience part-time job.  Uh – the first reason is that the college student should focus on their studies, and – uh – they have to search for many things that they – what they are doing to do after they graduated from university.  Uh – I think it is – uh – was of time to focus on irrelevant issues.  And second reason is that my student – uh – my friends told me that it was – wasn't worthwhile to spend their time doing part-time jobs.  They told me that they should have done something more worthi – worthy other than doing part-time jobs.
Doing part-time job is very important.  Um – first of all, you can learn social life that social life is totally different – different when you are going to your middle upper high school because when the age goes up in ti...
I agree because – uh – have a work experience and help students when they get their real job, I mean they will know what they are good at or not good at, and they – what they really want to be.  Also, they can realize how to save money and use money, because they know it is hard to earn more than use the money.  So, I think it is important for students to have part-time job experience before they get real job.
Uh – it would be a good experience to have a part-time job as – in college, because it can help find who you really are and what you're really good at.  Um – but my personal experience I find myself that I am interest in teaching and education industry by working as a tutor – like working as a part-time tutor at a personal institute, and I have decided to be a teacher then – after that.  So, – um – from my experience and my point of view it would be a very great asset to – uh – to be able to find your preparation or – preparation for your future.  You – it could help you get ready at everything based on...
I think part-time job for college students is very useful for them.  There are several reasons to support my idea.  First, it can be a good experience for them.  Many college students don't have many society experience, so part-time job is – um – really society time so you can meet many people and you have to handle many – many experience like – uh – [***] customers and unexpected guests [***].  Second, you can earn – earn money for your own – on your own – uh...
I disagree with college students having part-time jobs.  First of all, I think it will distro – disturb students studying because we study – because we work for 5 to 6 hours if we have part-time job then we gain like 2 million Won something but I think it's better to have greater – better grades and get a better job in – after we graduate then we will get more money than now that for few dollars, and second of all I think it's very dangerous – uh – you don't have any...
To continue my last – last speech I want to say that student who have to do the part job – part-time job they have to study more and spend more time on doing what they have to do more than not have a part job – a part-time job I think.  Uh – um – I think that's the duty for all students who have to study hard and looking for what they have to do and prepare for your future life.  Um – but some part-time job that related to their likes or future careers let...
There are several reason why our univer...college students have to part-time job.  First of all, they can learn social skill from their part-time job, for example – uh – by coming – by talk to the customer and the [***] they can learn how to – uh – communicate with a [***] person, and second they can – they can independence from their parents [***] and – uh – expect [***], and they can know value of money by earning their own money by themselves.  Uh – for this reason I think part-time job is very essential thing to – uh – university students, so I had...
I think it's good to experi... to experience the part-time in the early time of youngster because – uh – it's kind of good opportunity to – uh – go through the experience in the social position.  So, when I was 20 – 20 years old I worked in a to – tour.  I think it – it can help – it helped my op – experience or [***] job.
Um – I had on experience as a part-time worker.  I worked at department store as a server in the I – I – I ice cream shop, so I get them – I gave the customers ice creams and made some dessert and coffee.  Through that experience I build up my – uh – how – my – how to deal – deal with customers, and also I could get some money.  So, it was helpful for my university life, and I think it must be helpful my – helpful job seeking.
I agree about part-time job, because – uh – doing a part-time job can be very helpful.  Uh – we can – uh – we earn some money on our own, so we earn – we learn some – uh – how it is impor – how the money it is important and we can understand how my parents worked so hard for that – for – to make money for us.  Uh – and we can feel some thank – thankfulness about our parents and also we can be some kind of free – feel free about because we have our own money and we can do anything without [***] it, so we can feel – uh – we will feel happy about...
I disagree with the statement.  Uh – in my case when I – after I entered to university I had to start a part-time job, so it is quite hard to do both of them because my best goal is to have a great grade because I am student.  I have to spend time in get the money, so I couldn't concentrate on – uh – my study.  So, if it is possible I think that concentrate on their studies that way and it will be better to get the scho – scholarships from university than – I think that is the best way to get money comparing that doing some part-time job.
