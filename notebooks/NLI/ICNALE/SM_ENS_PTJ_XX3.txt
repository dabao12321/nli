I would say it is important, ah, in the sense that many students leave university with a large amount of debt and, therefore, having a part-time job and earning money, uh, while studying is a good way to avoid that – caught in a debt situation.  I disagree that having a job will actually – a part-time job will actually help you prepare for the workplace.  Uhm, such experience is – really seem to me of no value in finding work in the – uh, in wider world.  In fact, the less distracted you are from your studies and from the experience in university life to the fullest, the better, but students no longer have that freedom to explore all the opportunities available to them at university because they practically have to get a part-time...
I do think it is good for college students to have a part-time job.  Ah, firstly, they can earn some money which means they don't have to rely on their parents which is good for their parents and it also it gives them some independence.  Um, if they get money from their parents, then their parents can to a certain extent dictate what they use the money for and if they have their own money, then they are free to use the money, ah, as they wish.  Um, another thing is if they work, then, ah, they can, ah, maybe learn skills that they wouldn't learn at university.  Um, at university, the skills that they learn or the things that they learn are often very academic, uhm, and they might learn more practical things in a work place.  Uhm, you know, to do with handling money or – or taking responsibility or something like that.  Ah, another reason would be that maybe they can, ah, maybe learn some people skills at – at – at work.  Of course, at universities, they have seminars and...
I think it's important for a student to have a part-time job while studying because it helps them with discipline and managing schedules and having responsibility of not relying on your parents or someone else to support you through school and also it gives you a chance to have an exper – have working experience while you're studying.  As a student, I've had a couple of part-time jobs myself in the evenings in different schedules and had to manage time.  It helps to man – you to manage time effectively so I think having...
No, I don't think so that it's good for students to have a part-time job.  They should let the jobs to the people like – like normal workers or like people that don't have more money to study in the university who wants to work, you know.  You know, the students should be like, well, concentrate on their study and you know, keep on studying and let the jobs go for other people, young people who couldn't go to university or wanted to study and you know, they maybe need money for their house and you know for other things.  So, it should be better for them, like keep them on, you know, you're working and leave the students who are studying.  So, it's more productive for, you know, you know, normal workers, you know, they have a chance to buy the, some stuff, like yeah so, they can keep on earning their money.  You know, students, they should put money away earlier maybe or like help from your parents or someway.  I don't know it's like, yeah, I don't know, but I think, it's better for normal workers, they – they should take the part-time job and...
Yes, I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  It teaches them about responsibilities that they will have to face in the working world after they graduate.  Uh, you can also make connections with other people and learn about what types of jobs there are in the world and different things you would like to do.  Also, you can help support your education with the money from your part-time job, so you do not have as much debt after you finish school.  This will also help you get a better start after you graduate college, because then you do not have to worry about [***] loaned, so this is why I think it is a good idea for students to have a part-time job while in college. 
I can see both sides of the argument.  Um, having a part time job while you're in university is important to form some sort of appreciation for monetary value and not just leech off your parents.  However, I think that it's also important for stu – students who are serious to be able to get the education – the most of their education, when they are not working, uh, in a job.  So, I think that students who are not working have more time to study and can, um, give a lot more to their university education.  However, I myself worked at jobs as college student constantly, and I always saw it as a boon to my life experience.  So, um, I mean, I think that it's important to experience more to – to go and be in the world.
I believe that it is not important for students to have a part-time job for several reasons.  First of all, uh, in universities and while people are students, it is most important that people study and working takes away important time when students could be studying.  Uh, therefore, uh, if students have some free time, they should use it to increase their knowledge and increase their educational, uh, level.  Another reason that I think it is important for students not to have a job is, uhm, they will spend the rest of their live working after they e – exit university and that there is plenty of time left to work after study is completed.  Study is a time that is very special when we need to grow our minds and, uh, en – enjoy, uh, our times as much as possible.  Once we begin working, it is more difficult.
I don't think people should have part-time jobs if they're college students.  College is a very serious time to study, and I think that a part-time job would limit the student's ability to concentrate on school work.  So the other day, I was walking through the park and I heard some birds singing and I went to see where they were and I really don't have anything to say after my statement so I will just keep talking for 60 seconds.  Uhm, today the weather is rainy and it's kind of warm, but not so bad.  This is my second week in Japan and I hope that this I can get some money soon.  Uh, anything else to say?  I don't know.  Uhm, part time...
I do think it is a good idea for students to have a part-time job.  I have several reasons for this.  Of course, one reason is because of the money.  I don't think it's good for students to rely on their parents' money.  I think they should try to be independent.  And therefore, if they have a part-time job, then they can earn some money by themselves.  And this means that they have the actual money to use and also it means they have a feeling of independence themselves. Another reason would be so that they can learn some skills that they can't necessarily learn in a university, of course depending on what subjects they are studying.  A lot of the things you learn in the university are very academic, to do with books and that kind of thing, whereas in a part-time job you can learn things more like people skills or how to deal with unexpected situation.

Yeah, I agree that university students should have part-time job while they're studying and for a number of reasons, one of them is time management which is an important skill for them to learn.  I think they are given a lot of time in which to do their studies, which would probably be the argument against them having a part-time job is that they need the time to study.  But I think they are already given plenty of time and that the time that they wouldn't be doing their part-time job they wouldn't be using that valuably anyway. But, more importantly, I think it's good for the additional skills that you don't learn in university but you learn only in a job and that would – that kind of experience reflects very well on a resume.  And I think it's something that their future employers will look at.  They'll see that somebody that was able to manage the time and was able to hold down a job and learn certain things such as in the customer service industry.

Personally, I don't think it's important that every person has a part-time job while they are at college or university and this is because I believe pretty strongly that it depends on their individual situation.  Some people have, you know, large amount of credits that they're taking, some people have a few amount of credits that they're taking.  Some people have much more intensive majors or fields of study; other people, not so much.  There's also the economic situation of the family to consider.  So, if parents or grandparents or maybe family friends are contributing to the student's tuition, then maybe it's not quite as needed to...

I completely agree that any college student or university student should have a part-time job.  It not only helps them have some spending money so they can go out on weekends and have some fun, buy some things, but it also, most importantly I think kind of prepares them for their future.  Being able to work, get kind of some experience, whether it's internship that's part-time or whether it's part-time to bring in some money, they are both – this is really important, it's kind of preparing you for what lies ahead. Many college students kind of take university is the time to kind of party which it is, but it's also time to prepare and get ready for a future to do that through your studies, through your classes, but also the same time you are building experience by having a part-time job, so those are pretty much my two...

I believe that having a part-time job in school is an important aspect of one's learning, um, not only does it help with interpersonal skills that people will need in the workplace, it also provides valuable experience or that can be added to a person's resume.  Often times, employers look for a person's skill, not just where they graduated from but what kind of things they have already involved themselves in.  For example, they will look at internships.  They will look at previous achievements and not just academic grades.  So, I believe it's very important to have a part-time job because this will not only boost your resume, but it will also provide you with invaluable experience that cannot be bought or learned in the classroom while the class...
I agree that student should have a part-time job while they're completing their education.  Having a part-time job helps you keep one foot in the working world and one foot in the academic world.  The academic world can be very in filler for you to have one foot in the real world, is helpful for when you actually graduate from the university.  Also, it's important to financially support yourself. The cost of education these days is going up and up.  And any burden that the student can take off parents or society by providing for themselves is going to be of a huge benefit.  Also, there are the satisfaction of earning a wage and helping to support yourself in life.  These are qualities that will be very useful once you've graduated...
It is – is it – it is not necessarily important for every student or every college student to have a part-time job.  It depends on a person's financial situation in many cases or, um, it can also depend on whether one want to gain vital experience in his chosen field, you know, his or her chosen field of study.  It may also be a good way of gaining experience which might be necessary in the work area.  For myself, I had a part-time job in college.  It was mostly based on the financial reasons.  It – but it's also served as a good, um, exposure to, um, working environment, um, critical skills and, uh, of values which we have – which have helped me to be a better work experi...
Um, if there is some people say that college students need a part-time job, I do agree with this statement because I think that college student, uh, need the experience of working in a workplace.  They also, um, need – need experience – they need the experience of working in a workplace so they can experience working with other people and around other people.  They can be prepared for being in the job with other people after they do graduate.  But I also think that some college students, especially American college students don't really know what they want to do after they graduate and I think having a part-time job can really give them some experience and some ideas of things that they are like to do, things that they might not want to do, things that they might enjoy. I think it should be...
I think it really depends on the situation – the financial situation of the college student.  If they need money, of course, I think they should have a part-time job to support their studies, but if not, I think it would be better if they focus on their studies and not, um, spend time on the part-time job outside.  I understand that having a part-time job can teach responsibility and other things that you cannot learn in school, but I think that such things can also easily be learned in other activities, uh, that the college or university can provide such as, um, ships abroad to do social work such as earthquake relief work, feeding the hungry that kind of thing.  I think, um, college is the time just before work that you know it's – it's the time before you go out and have a crazy, busy life at work.  So, I think if you can, if your financial circumstances allow it, I think you should enjoy it.
I think it really depends on the country that we are talking about.  Um, in the case of the United States, um, one of the recent issues that has come up is the – um, the fact that college tuition, the cost of college has been rising considerably in the last couple years.  And so for many students, um, it is important for them to take a part-time job while they are going to school because they need to earn money, um, to be able to support their, um, living expenses and even pay for tuition while they are there.  However, in the – in the case of another country, such as Japan, I might say that it's better if the student does not –if college students do not – um, if college students do not take a part-time job because it is a great opportunity at university for them to try many new things and join many different clubs or perhaps go traveling and – and – um, and...
I think it's a good idea for college students to have a part-time job.  Um, it teaches the students responsibility, gives them an opportunity to experience the workplace.  Um, I think it helps to mature them too.  Um, I have heard that college expense in Japan is very high, so I really think that whether the job is to help with college expenses or as you hear these days it's used to help for pocket money for the students in either case, I think it's good for the student to be able to, um, help and supporting themselves in some way, any money that they would make, uh, as they work could be put away, uh, or used anyway for pocket money that their parents wouldn't need to pay, uh, for their college education.
I agree and disagree that students who are attending college should have a part-time job.  I agree because it teaches responsibility and it teaches you how to multitask. In life, you can't just focus on one thing.  A lot of times there are other responsibilities that you have.  So, if you work and go to school at the same time, it's teaching you discipline, it's teaching you responsibility, it's teaching you life lessons and how to handle different situations while doing two different things at the same time.  I disagree that or I don't – I don't think everyone should have to.  Everybody's situation is different.  So there are circumstances where one may not be able to work while attending college.  So, it's not that...
Yes, I think it is good for young people to take a part-time job while they are in college and my reason is this; number one, if their parents pay everything, where they will not as mean as much to them, but if they do work part-time, they feel like they have done something for their own education.  I think it is good for the kids to learn some – some things and work ethics while they're in college as well.  And it's good for them and also it makes the parents feel like they are trying to help with pay expenses for their own education.  Another – another reason is it puts them in the workplace where they learn how to work with other people and do things together.  So, I think it's probably really a good thing for a certain student to work while they are in college.  Now, the type of work would be therefore would be on what their abilities are.  They should try and do...
Yes, I agree with the topic, uh, that students should have a part-time job when they are in college if at all possible.  Uh, I think that it teaches them a lot of things of working with others and, uh, maybe even, uh, a trade that they could do later on and when they need extra work.  And also, uh, it teaches them discipline as they have to find time to study and find time to work.  And it makes them very, uh, conscious of time and using it rightfully.  When I was in college, I had a part-time job working in the kitchen and dining hall, and then I became a cook in the dining hall and I learned a lot about cooking, and after college, uh, was able to have my...
Yes, I think it's important to – for some people to be able to work part-time while they are at college.  I – I realize this does not apply to everybody because it's not a straightforward across the thing because some people it might – they might have different situations.  I know that someone is coming from a foreign country doesn't know the language very well, so it would be much more difficult for them to take a part-time job versus their native speaker it might be helpful.  Um, as far as in America, it – it's very helpful because people would sometimes, um, I know when I went to college, a lot of people would just goof up from their free time and a lot of other things but, um, it helps them to be able to have a job, to be able to help provide for some of their, uh, education, and because they are paying for a part of it, it helps them to have a little more spending money as well, but also takes the education a little bit more seriously.  Um, this might not be a problem in Japan, but in America it is somewhat and so this...
I think whether a college student has a part-time job or not depends on the student.  For some students, they really need the time to be able to concentrate on their studies, but if they're going to be just wasting time with partying and running around with friends instead of studying, then their time would be better spent doing a part-time job.  Also, a part-time job can help with finances and sometimes the busier we are, the more we get done because we have to, we have to budget our time better.  So for  --  for some students, yes, a part-time job would be a very good thing, for many students in fact.  I suppose, for some students it would keep them out of trouble because college students can tend to get into a lot of trouble, uh, because they have too much time on their hands because they are not studying enough.  So, it would depend on the student, it would depend on the college, at some colleges the rules are stricter and so, um, or the academic standards are high -- 
I believe or understand that you're asking is it important to have a part-time job.  I really do not believe that it is necessary.  It is necessary to spend your time wisely and not to, um, and to use your time for eternal things and not for just, uh, having money and spending money on frivolous things.  Um, a part-time job maybe something someone, uh, could be interested in, it's not a bad thing but it is not necessary in today's day and age.  What is necessary is the Lord Jesus Christ and the time that we spend studying His word and studying and sharing and spending time telling others about Him.  That's where our time should be spent.  Um, it – it – it's different if you are the head of the home as a man...
While I do agree that having a part-time job is, uh, more useful for students or is of importance to students, uh, I only think so because the amount of debt that many students leave university with is a huge financial burden and that working your way through college is about the only way to try and avoid that situation in later life.  Uh, I am guessing that a lot of people argue that having a part-time job in some way prepares students for working in the wider world and that I should disagree with.  Uhm, I don't think a part-time job is of any particular value in terms of work experience or gaining experience of work environment or whatever.  In fact, students should be better off spending their time making the most of other opportunities in university.
Um, so another reason for working, for, um, having a good reason for having a part time job is that I was saying was to, ah, learn skills that they might not get at university.  Ah, for example, even a – a kind of low level job like working in a convenient store or – or any of the other jobs that, um, the students often have even if those skills that they use in the workplace aren't necessarily connected to their course of study or might not be connected to what they do in the future.  It's still, um, experience and it still might come in handy in the future, um, and if the part time jobs that they have is connected somehow to the work that they want to do, then it might be a good way to, um, to make connections or you know build contacts that will be useful for them in the future.  So, I think it is important for them to have a – a – a part time job.  I think it also – it gives people confidence.  You know, if you've only been – only have experience in one area...
I think it's important for a student to have a part-time job while they're studying because it teaches them responsibility and it helps manage time.  They can learn effective time management skills and also gain experience in working with people while you're a student or while you're still studying.  I've had numerous part-time jobs or a few part-time jobs during my time as a student, and I think it's important not to rely on your parents or someone else to help support you fully through college or your education.
College students should not go by – doing part-time job.  They should study as hard as possible, because they're, you know, man the – the job is important for other people, maybe there are some people who need opportunity to enter like get a job, earn some money.  They maybe learn some things, how to go on the future, you know, it's like important and then, I know college students should concentrate on their studies, keep on studying hard, you know so in the future, they're going to get a job.  They've, you know, they have – they're going to earn good money at that time.  There're some people, if they don't work – they don't get, they're not possible they are going to university or they couldn't get – earn enough like you know, graduate or something.  So, you know, these people need to work, you know.  So, let them go to a part-time job, enjoy their life, and you know, yeah, students enjoy their life and like, poor people who couldn't go to university, they should go study, not study, I mean, they should go like, you know, working part-time or something, earn some money.  Maybe they have opportunity of getting better and better and then, one day...
I think it is important for students – college students to have a part-time job.  Uh, when I was a student, I worked at a pizza place, and it taught me a lot about time management, to finish the tasks I had to complete before the end of the day, and it also taught me about managing about my own money that I make and being responsible for my own food and bills.  I also, uh, learned about the responsibilities you have when you have money, such as paying taxes and keeping your account straight.  So, during college, uh, some students do not know how to do these kinds of things because they come from a family where all of that was done for them.  So, before they leave and go out into the real world, they can learn about these kinds of...
I believe that having a part time job while you're in university can serve to counter the isolating effects of the ivory tower of education.  Being involved in academia is a very abstract endeavor in most cases, and I think that while you have the opportunity to be more involved in studies, I think that having a part-time job can be beneficial, so long is it's not your only source of income.  I think that if colleges can be made affordable enough or students can be given grant so that they don't have to work, but still are required or, you know, have the – the desire to work, then those students will benefit in the long run.  Uh, I don't think that it's, uh, anything that, I don't know, should be dictated, I guess, or not required.  Uh, but I do think that it would, uh, that helpful.
I do not believe it is important for students to have a part-time job, uh, for several reasons.  First of all, when a person is a student, the most important thing for them to do is to study.  If a person has a part-time job, then they are distracted from their studies and they lose important time when they could be learning new things.  Uh, being a student is a special time and working is a different time that happens after university.  Another reason why I think students should not have a part-time job is that after university, students will have to work.  Uh, you have to work for several reasons because you must pay for your education or pay for your family or pay for your – your lifestyle.  So while you are a student, I think you should enjoy your time where you don't have to work.  Working is something that you will spend the rest of your life doing and while you're a student, you should spend your time studying and having fun and enjoying...
People shouldn't have part-time jobs while going through college because they need all their time to study.  Uhm, I think that if they have to work part time, they won't have enough time to study and sleep and get all their work done.  I think this is a big problem in America where I'm from because a lot of college – a lot of people enter college but don't graduate.  They enter part-time jobs and their part-time job, it turns into a full-time job and they end up not finishing school and, therefore, reaching their full potential.  I think that's a big problem especially in America where I think more than half the people don't graduate who enter college.  Uh, I don't know what to say so I'll just talk about what I think the Olympics were at this week.  Olympics were finished and...
I agree that students should have a part-time job.  The first reason is for – to be able to earn some money.  I don't think that students should rely on their parents.  I think they should make some money themselves and obviously having a part-time job is a good way to do that.  The other reason is that they can use – they can learn some skills and use skills that they won't necessarily be able to use in a university.  it's strange actually.  I could think of lots of things but the beeping is quite distracting, and you said that I should keep talking continuously even though I've kind of run out of things to say now. So anyway, I think that students should have a part-time job because they can use things – they can use skills that they can't necessarily use in a university situation, and also they might be able to make...

Yeah I – I agree that university students should have a part-time job and I think – I mean there's a lot of different reasons why you could say that you would do it.  But I think most importantly is because of how it would look on a resume after university, and I think it would look really well because it teaches a lot of valuable skills.  One of the most important ones is time management, so they will be managing their time and I think that's something that maybe a lot of people would criticize or think as a disadvantage to holding a part-time job is that university students should be focusing only on their studies.  But I don't think they are going to use that time or that extra time on their studies, so they might as well use it for work. It also provides them with a network or starts to get them used to networking, which is probably more valuable than anything that they would get out of university and it is certainly something that people tell – when you take something like an...

Personally, I don't believe that it's particularly important for each person to have a part-time job if they are in university or college, and this is mainly because the situation of the person can vary drastically from person to person.  And this is because people come from different backgrounds.  They may or may not have previous job experience.  They may or may not have stable income in their family.  They may or may not have a really intensive major.  So, it depends on the needs of the family, of the individual themselves, and what their priorities are.  It can be advantageous for some and it can be disadvantageous for some.  The job market also can vary from region to region.

Well I was cut off last time, so as I was saying there my two main points to why this is so important is, one, that extra spending money; and two, which is to prepare you for your future.  So, to kind of expand on these two points, the first, which is to have some extra money, I know when I was a university student there's many friends of mine, even myself at times [***] want to go out on a weekend, but my God, I don't have a job.  Didn't have a part-time job.  Once I got one, I had the money, was able to do it. Back to my second point which is that it kind of helps prepare you for your future, one important thing that it teaches is time management.  Time management is very key where you need to get a healthy balance of working, your school work, your friends, your relationships.  Some people may spend too much time at school, too much time at work, but if you – when you...

Well, the purpose of the academics is to train students one thing that is often lacking is the actual real-world experience.  This is why a lot of times companies are hesitant to employ recent graduates because they lack experience.  I believe having the part-time job while being in school helps to give this valuable experience to student so that way when they reach the real-world workplace, they are not left with just a degree but they actually have experience that they can utilize in the workplace.  I also believe this is important because employers are looking for this.  So, it gives you something to put on your resume instead of saying I had a 4.0 GPA, you can also say I had good grades but I also have this experience, um, because interpersonal skills cannot be learned in the classroom.  There's something that are learned through experience and having a part-time job provides opportunities to work in a real-world environment.  Um, that...
I agree with the statement that, uh, college students should have a part-time job while they are in education.  It helps them keep one foot in the real world, so to speak, and also one foot in the academic world.  The academic world can be very in filler.  So, it's very good to be outside of that – the world and to actually work.  The cost of education is very expensive these days so also for the student to be able to support themselves and take the burden off parents or, uh, society can only be of benefit.  Also, there is the feeling of satisfaction of – for the student of being able to support themselves and contribute to putting themselves through their education and providing for themselves while they are completing their education.  Although, they should balance their work and study life...
Many people can gain vital experience through part-time jobs.  Um, some people have never worked before and they left high school or went straight on to college.  A part-time job is a good way of training them as to what giving them good idea that what the work – work world might be like, um, providing them with skills and experience which may be necessary to – to allow them to advance in their chosen career path.  Uh, I learnt many things.  I worked in the wood shop.  I worked in the library at my university and, uh, I gained valuable experience and little skills which I find useful today in the – in my current field of work.  Uh, you can learn creativity.  You can learn, uh, how to handle different situations, um, in your current field based on your...
I think that college students need to have a part-time job so they can get experience working in the workplace.  I think that they might not necessarily know what they want to do when they graduate from college and I think the idea that they can get some experience, um, some ideas of things that they might want to do, things they might not want to do can be incredibly helpful.  I think that they need the experience of being in a job, having a job and being around other people, working with other people.  Um, that they need to have that experience before they enter full-time workplace because I think that will give them a better idea of what they  --  what is expected of them when they do get to a real job.  I also think that they should have a part-time job so that they can, uh, have some extra money.  I know that a lot of college students are on scholarship these days and so I think having that extra money would be really beneficial to them so they don't have to worry about -- 
I think having a part-time job in college depends on the financial situation of the college student.  If the college student is needy and needs financial assistance or additional funds to complete university, I think then a part-time job is good if he can  --  he or she can juggle that with his or her studies.  But I think that if the financial situation allows, the student should not take a part-time job in order to spend more time focusing on studies and also socializing because I feel that socializing is an important part of college life.  Uh, the networks you make in college, in university will serve you well in your work life in the future.  Also, the skills and the knowledge learnt in the part-time job that you can't otherwise learn at school can also be learned in other school or university activities, uh, such as, uh, overseas, social work, or clubs, societies, uh, that help -- 
I think the answer depends on which country you are talking about.  In the case of the United States, uh, one of the recent issues that we have been dealing with is the fact that college tuition, the cost of university has been rising considerably and it's become so expensive that many college students have to take, uh, a part-time job or sometimes even a full-time job in order to get income to pay for their living, expenses for their textbooks and pay for tuition.  However, in the case of Japan, I might disagree and say that we do not – the college students should not take a part-time job because during college, it's one of the few times in their lives in Japan – Japanese society when they have so much – they have so much free time that they can try many different things and join many different clubs in order to, uh, gain new experiences and meet new people and try new things and discover new things, um, if they can also take the time to travel or to, um, and to explore different cultures in different countries.  And so I think, um, it's important for the college students in Japan to have the time to...
I think it's a good idea for, uh, students to be able to work or have a part-time job while they are in college.  Um, it gives the student an opportunity to, uh, experience the workplace and, uh, to mature as they work there and it helps them to learn to get along with people that they work with.  Uh, it also helps them to, uh, handle their, uh, time more wisely so that they can use, uh, the  --  the amount of time they need for study and also have time for work.  Um, college expenses in Japan are quite, uh, high now and this gives this student an opportunity to either help with that or to help with their pocket money which is the reason that you hear that most students work these days.  Um, I think that in either case, it would be good for the student to be able to work and help with these things.
Like I said, I agree that, uh, colleges – college students should be able to hold the part-time time – part-time job while going to school but at the same time, if they don't, then, uh, they shouldn't be looked down upon because they don't – because everybody's situation is different.  Some people are able to attend school without working and some people are able to attend school with working.  So, it depends on the situation.  However, having a job while attending college at the same time does produce, uh, characteristics of being responsible and disciplined and teaching you how to multi-task different things while having to work and go to school which are two different things important, uh, task that everyone has to deal with.  Uh, but I also do feel that if you don't attend, then there is nothing wrong with that as well if you don't.
Yes, I think it's good for young people to work part-time while they are in college and I think it's good for them for several reasons.  Uh, number one, it helps to pay for their college bill itself and that would make their parents feel good as well.  Number two, they are also, uh, earning money to help pay their way to the school and that's good for them.  And number three, it would be also they would be, um, uh, wor – working with other people and so it helps to learn how to work with other people.  And if we had a fourth one, it would probably be that of, uh, learning some things that will help them later on in life.  And for fifthly, it would also give them a sense of accomplishment they are doing something while they are in school and who knows they might even go into that after they graduate from college of that particular...
Yes, I do think that students in college should have a part-time job if at all possible, if their health will allow them to do it and, uh, basically able to at least, uh, have work along with their school work.  It helps them to discipline themselves and – and use their time wisely.  It also, um, helps them to learn how to work with people and learn even, uh, on something more than book learning.  And, uh, so I just think it's wise to have students, uh, study and work other than just studying.  It gets them on their feet and do some exercise with – with their own alert [***].  And I had a part-time job when I was in college and it helped me in many ways so I have been able to earn more money for school bill.  My parents did pay for most of my college education...
Yes, I think it's important for people, uh, that are going to college – a lot of people it's good for them to have a part-time job some – some more than other people, um, versus the foreigners coming from a foreign country I probably wouldn't recommend having that.  Um, but if they are native speakers, I think it's a good for a person that has, uh, part-time job while they are at college and maybe not, uh, one that would demand like a whole lot of their time but at least just some of their time so that also they could have – are able to have education of maybe working in a specific field and then working with other people as well.  It also helps them to appreciate, um, the money, the cost to have their education and so they'll take their education a little more seriously and they really work hard at it, um, trying to learn of whatever my major is.  Um, it also helps their parents as well if their parents are funding the bills, it really helps them along knowing that they care or how much it costs and they are – are – are very appreciative, uh, more of...
I think whether a student has a part-time job or not would depend on the student.  Whether it's good for the student or not would depend on the person.  For some students, they are more diligent with their studies, they're going to spend the time with their studies, they're going to be more disciplined in studying hard while they're in college.  For other students who might tend to want to play around who wouldn't study as hard, um, a part-time job is probably a good thing, it may help them to discipline their time more, to budget their time better.  Often the busier we are the more careful we are with our time, because we know that we have to be.  Also, for some students, they need to help financially if having a part-time job and that way they are not relying so much on their parents and the parentsf finances.  There are also many good things that a person can learn in a part-time job, good discipline, respect for authority, um...
It is not necessary to have a part-time job.  It is necessary to use our time wisely, to use it for the Lord, to use it to study the things of God's Words so that we can share with others.  It is not necessary to financially, uh, get – gain from having a job, what is necessary is that we spend our time wisely learning and educating ourselves about things that are – have eternal value.  Um, God has been so good to us, and we will spend our time learning more about Him and not worry about financial gain.  This is a – uh – a subject that part-time job is not – uh, it would be to spend time just to have something to do, but in general, uh, you wouldn't need a part-time job, um, hmm.  Someone who has a full-time job might be a man who has a wife and family to take care of or him...
