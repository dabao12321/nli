It's important for college students to have a part-time job not just because we get many experience, we also can learn how to organize our time in one day, like we need to organize what time we need to work, what time we need to study or relax ourselves.

I think it is important for college students to have a part-time job in the future.  In my opinion, I think that you should only have one part-time job because for college student, you also need to have education in your college.  But when you have many part-time job, you don't have other time for your education, because when you have too many times in the part-time job, you may - don't know how to prepare for your scores, but I think that it's very important for college students to have a part-time job in the future because you can have – you can make friends in the job because in the future you know how to – know how to have a conversation with your customers and your friends because in the – because now in the future we have...

Well, I think that it's important for college students to have a part-time job.  I agree this topic.  To have a part-time job, students maybe more responsibilities because students have to be response to their jobs, so they can't be lazy or they can't – not – not to do anything on their job times.  I think besides if students have a part-time job, they may use this time wisely that because they – you have to do their schoolwork, so they may think how to use their time when they have to do their – their part-time jobs.  So I totally agree that it's good for students to have the part-time job, and that's very important.  If a student...
I strongly agree it's important for college students to have a part-time job because I have a part-time job too.  I work at theatre, and I work every weekend.  I went to the theatre and provide the lights to customer [***].  I learned a lot on how to provide service to customers, and I think I learned more patient.  And a part-time job can make the students grow up.  I think every college student needs to have a part-time job and – and money, so there is – there is help.  My job is hard, but I do my best.
Yes, I agree with this statement.  I [***] people, so it's important for college students to have a part-time job.  I really agree because I have a part-time job too.  I think the part-time job not only make money and also can learning a lot of things besides school or of your book – more than your book.  In part-time job, you can – you can know so many – a lot of people, different people.  I think part-time job is very important for everyone.  You can learn very – you can learn a lot of lessons in part-time job, and also you can make money definitely.
Well, I think I will disagree because I think don't have experience for working before graduating in school.  We are studying now.  We are students.  All we need to do is [***] knowledge, and we will need that first.  Because a lot of money to get your college diploma, then you just spend your time to have a part-time job, and unfortunately, it's not a good idea to do this [***] they just want to have a part-time job, still in my opinion, professor also have bad job experience surely in their own classes too.  That's why...
I agree it because part-time job for college student is a good experience.  In future, they can take the experience to make themselves to be good, be a better person because they have learned many things, and every part-time jobs are good.  I have many friends also doing the part-time jobs; they like it and do it.  I think part-time job can make the student's life more interesting.  I also do a part-time job in my school, just in library, to help to do something and just something and although sometimes I feel very tired, but I like to do it.  It's very interesting.
Of course, I agree of college students to have a part-time job.  First, I think college score is not heavier than high school.  Using your free time to get a job is necessary.  Second, school fee is too high.  Getting a job also can help them make money to help to ensure their end meets, reduce stress for their family.  Third, I think some student actually follow legislation [***] or something else expensive if they can use their money that makes them expensive, right?  So, college students if may have free time, why not get a part-time job?
I do really have a feeling that it is very – it is very important for, you know, especially college students to – they have to work part-time, especially, you know, when they are those who – who are somehow, you know, their parents – whose parents are, you know, somehow pretty overprotective, and what I do not like, and therefore I think that – that every – every – every person and every college students to get trained and they have to keep the tolerance when – whenever confronted with troubles or difficulties, no matter where or what they, you know, what they have done, and you know, personally, I also work.  I have got three part-time jobs at the moment.  Those might be considered as a challenge you know because I have to handle it with all the stress and...
For me, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job because it's – it's a chance – it's a chance to knew something.  You don't have to – you don't have to – you don't have to – you don't have to experience it.  In the part-time job, you can learn many things like something with persons getting along or other things plus part-time job.  I – so – so I think there is one confusion [***] thus we have to know – take more – take a lot of job in the part-time job.  Also, we have to take – take care of our study and our family and friends.  We have to...
Yes, I agree with it – I agree students who is major in business or some – something like language, you can take a part-time job because you can know lots of people and you can see different kind of people and know different kind of people.  But if you major in something like engineer, for instance, you don't have to make too many friends and you have to focus on your – your major, so you don't need to take a part-time job.  But business people – you can take a part-time job.  And yeah take me for – take myself for example, I do have part-time job, and it changed me a lot, and...
I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job.  I think the normal college student should not only study but also have to learn more about other important things like how to do well in our life or how to be good about manner [***].  When the college students do well on these things, it is also good for their future.  So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, but there is also another important thing is the college student should also be good at the major subject in their studies.
I think – in my view of point, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job because they should do something different in their college – life of college and learn something different outside the class, and I think they can get sense of achievement.  If me, I would decide to try for better or worse, that can train their ability of communication with guests and ability of interview with their boss, and I – I think the ability is important when you graduate...
I believe that students should have a part-time job because doing – doing a part-time job can make students increase more experience about society work.  I think it is very important to have a part-time job in student time.  As for me, I have a part-time job in Okonomiyaki restaurant.  During time, I have learned about many things, about general [***] service or cleaning the plate and soda [***].  It is very tired about working in a restaurant, but it is really worth of it.
I think have some part-time work is going to – is useful.  These part-time jobs help us realize how tough it may be at work, but also plus – plus they very enhance our social life skills and practical knowledge.  My first part-time work was fast-food shop waiter.  It was rather tough thing.  I was just a [***], but I learned to pull my face into other issues.  All that can be a lot of ways that practical is presence more important than in school.  I got my first receipt to buy cell phone for me.  This is the first gift I didn't – didn't ask my mom to buy it for me.  I feel so wonderful because...
I agree it's very – find a part-time job is very important for us.  We college students for looking a part-time job, although it's while money is not very high, they still have a lot help to us.  We also can release the parent's – family's burden.  The parent work hard for providing us to study, so we have to less their burden, yeah.  It's also a good – good – also a good trend to us.  We can let us know how to – how to communicate...
Let me think about it.  I think it's not really – if they – because if they have part-time job, they also have to be able to finish their study.  If their job spends too much time and they can't finish their homework, then I think that part-time job is not necessary to the student.  But otherwise if they can handle both things very well, I will think the part-time job is important because they can learn something they can't learn in the school and they can have more experience.  I think that it's really good for...
Yes, I agree.  I agree that students have a part-time job, they can make students have experience.  Go ahead to part-time job, students who have a level of school work.  That is important part-time job in student time but students work is important too.  Doing a part-time job can make student increase more experience about adult world.  So I think it is important.  My...
My parents didn't agree to have a part-time job.  They were saying it is wasting my time; however, many of my college teachers suggest us to find a part-time job.  They think we can learn many things from doing a part-time job.  In my opinion, I agree it is important to have a part-time job to college students.  And it is a good thing for a college student to do, but don't do it to over, and don't let part-time job affect your grade in school.  About this, I agree this opinion, and although many people – although many adults didn't agree that.
I think it is important for college student to have a part-time job because – because we should increase more experiences about – about doing some job that – that we would adapt to our formal jobs easily.

Then, you can learn from them, and you can earn some money if you have free time beside you – your – besides, you can learn...
Well, no.  I think that everyone just have only one time for their university life.  If a university student has part-time job, the job may affect their schoolwork and their study time.  Also, their leisure time will be shorter at the same time.  Although, it is said that many employers like their employees with work experience before, but there are many things that are important than part-time job or the money earned from it.  For me, I think that it is okay to have the first job of life after graduation because everyone needs to work for a long time after graduation from university.
Well, I think it is important for college students to study hard at their subject, but it is also important for college student to have a part-time job.

Well, I think that it's important for college students to have a part-time job.  To have a part-time job, students may be more responsibility to their job.  So, it's good to have a part-time job.  Besides, if a student has a part-time job, they may use their time wisely because they have to learn how to use their time to have a part-time job and to finish their schoolwork in 24 hours a day.  And I think, to have a part-time job, students will be more experienced in their future because they have learned how to work in a society because if they don't have a part-time job, they may be strange to work, and they may not do so well on their work, so...
I strongly agree it is important for college student to have a part-time job because I have a part-time job too.  I work in theatre.

It's important lessons in your life when you have part-time job and quickly notice social [***].  So, I think a part-time job is...
Well, I will say that again, disagree, because now I am a student.  All I have to do or we have to do is [***] all knowledge and ability in school.  And I think because of lot of money to get the college diploma [***] that's why we have to get the crisis because of experience.  We spend our time – precious time to have a part-time job.  And I think it's not a good idea to do – get a part-time job.  Maybe, people will say that they want to have a part-time job experience in their opinion, yes, but I think professor also have a lot of...
I agree.  I think it's very important for college students to have part-time job.  I think part-time job is very, very important.  It's a good experience and every part-time jobs are good.  I have many friends also doing the part-time jobs in many where – many and they like it and do it very well.  And I think part-time job is – it can make the student's life more interesting and funny.  Because college students have many times to do, not just reading, study, or just at school, I think it's very boring and – and not interesting.  And I also do the part-time job in my school, just in library.
First, I think that college score is not heavier than high school.  Using the free time to get a job I think is necessary.  Second, the school fee is too high to pay.  Getting a job also can help them make money to help to assure their ends meet, reduce stress for their family, it's very important.  So, I think – some students that follow legislation [***] or something expensive things.  If they can use their money, they make expense right.  So, why not get a part-time job, college.  So, college students if they have free time, why not get a part-time job?  They can learn the skill on part-time job.  After graduating, maybe they can get formal job easily.
According to my last speech, which was not actually finished, I want to say that I personally also work, and I have got three part-time jobs at the moment, and you know, during the week, I usually, you know, except for studying and except – except for taking courses at the university, I really go working usually – usually in the evening.  And this is what I consider very important and what I have learned a lot so far because, you know, it is quite a lot – it is quite stressful, I really have to say and – but – but you know, on – on the other hand – on the other hand, I did – I did – I did somehow learn something, how to channel stress.  And well, this is something that, you know, a normal person or a normal student who has not worked at all.  They would – it would be pretty hard for them to – to imagine in – in minds because they would say, “Oh, it's – it's pretty easy, you know...
I think part-time job is very – very hard to – to learn something – job – job [***] in the future.  And if we – if we have a part-time job, we can learn many, many things, and we can know many people, and we can know how to get along with the people and learn more – learn more things like the job.  And we can – we can not only learn the major in – in our school but also in the social school.  So I think the part-time job is important for the college students.  Yes, for me, I have a part-time job, and I learned many things.  And I have – by the part-time job, I can learn – I can knew many people – knew many...
I think the people – the students major in business or language department, you can take a part-time job because you can know more people, know more – know more things about society that you – you should know, and you can know different people, not just in your – in your school.  But if you are engineer – you are an engineer or something like that, I think you could just focus on your study because you don't have to know too – too many people.  And I am a business – I am in a business department so take myself, for example, I met lots of friends in – when –when at my working place, and it's cool and you can know more different things that you should know, for instance...
Many college students have a part-time job in Taiwan, but there are also many college students in Taiwan, they do well on their part-time job, but they don't do well on their study.  That is a very bad thing I think, but – because there are students in the part-time job, it's not their major, many of them can graduate from their college.  So I think that it is important for college students to have a part-time job, but there is also another important thing is the college students should also be good at the major subject in their study.
In my view of point, I think it's important for college students to have a part-time job because they can train their ability of interviewing with their boss and communication with guests and training their skills to self deal with something trouble and they can make friends – different friends from their class, and – and they can learn something different.  They can get sense of achievement.  I think this is important...
I – I believe that students should have a part-time job because during part-time job, we can learn many things that we can't learn at school.  I have experience of working in a restaurant about Okonomiyaki restaurant, and I really think it is worth of it.  Although it is very tired about doing many things, about cleaning and face to the customers, but it is really – it is a challenge for me, so I really think it is important to have a part-time job in our school life.
I think have some part-time work is presence is useful.  It doesn't just help us realize how tough it may be at work but also plus they very enhance our social life skills and practical knowledge.

As I said – I said before, I think if they have part-time job, they have to be able to finish their study and if the job spends too much time and they can't finish their homework, then I think that part-time job is not necessary to them.  But if they can handle both things, I think part-time job is important because it can teach students other things that they can't learn in the school, and they can have more experience.  I think it is very important for me.
I agree that students have a part-time job after school, but school work is more important to both the student, so – but I – I will – I think about it.

I agree to have a part-time job during – during college although many people didn't agree that, my parents, for example.
