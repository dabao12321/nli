I couldn't catch the question exactly, but I think he said that smoking should be banned in restaurants, uhm, to which my opinion is kind of mixed.  Um, I don't like people smoking in restaurants.  I'd prefer if I was in a nonsmoking area, but I also know a lot of my friends and relatives are smokers and it kind of be quite difficult for them to manage to sit down for a meal or spend a significant length of time without smoking, and for these people, it's nice to have places where they can sit down and eat and smoke in comfort, and I don't see any particular benefit in denying them that choice.  Uhm, on balance I think smoking is a terrible addition and...
I do think that, um, smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  Ah, smoking has very, ah, negative health.  Ah, it – it affects the health very negatively and not only the person who's smoking but also passive smoking.  It affects all the people around, um, and in restaurants, even if the smoking area is, um, portioned off, I mean the smoke floats, it does go in several areas and so it will affect the people who - who even aren't smoking so I definitely think it should be, ah, banned in restaurants.  Actually, I'm from the UK and, um, smoking has been banned in all public places, restaurants and clubs and that kind of thing and according to the, ah, government figures, um, it has – had a really, really good effect on the health as a population like the amount of people who have died from, ah, health disease or...
I think that smoking should be allowed in public spaces or restaurants and other type of establishments but only in designated areas and that the smoking area should be minimal compared to the non-smoking area.  If people choose to smoke and continue smoking, then they should have a chance or a place to do so but it should not interfere with the people who are following a healthy lifestyle and not smoking and the places should be regulated more in the cities of non-smoking areas and be more separate and people should not be allowed to smoke on...
I don't think smoking in a restaurant maybe it's not that good, but you know, when these people get addicted, they cannot stop smoking, you know.  Every time, they sit at the restaurant, they eat, they eat, they eat, you know, they want to smoke and why not.  I think it's good to have like a nice separate smoking area in every restaurant, you know, really nice separate area – smoking area.  Not just like next to the other side, you know, just like windows, door and air conditioning, all this stuff, so these people like can sit inside there enjoying smoking, eat their food and smoking, you know.  I'm sure nobody get bothered, you know.  Normal people who don't like to smoke, they sit down, and they just relax and other people smoke as much as they want and – and you know, problem solved.  I mean, I am like I'm smoking and I – I sometimes, I like it, usually you find somebody next to me smoking and I reach him, but you know, some places it's fair, you know people could smoke and then, separately, there's a smoking area, people don't like the smoking area and they should not...
Uh, I do not think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants all over the country.  Uh, one, it will be bad for businesses, because people who want to relax or smoke after their meal, they may be not be able to in the places they used to go.  Um, also, for people who do work in restaurants are not allowed smoking.  If there is a place they cannot smoke, then they may not go there anymore.  Um, also, if people cannot smoke in restaurants, they may start smoking outside more, and on the street, which would not be good for other people, because then they will smoke around people who don't want to smell smoke.  So, actually keep it in the smoking section, I think it is better to do that than to make them find somewhere else to have to smoke around people who don't want to.
I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in restaurants all across the country with the exception that, um – I think that businesses who make a certain percentage of their sales off of tobacco should allow the consumption of tobacco within their – their premises.  I mean, since the question is general and pertains the smoking, I would also extend this to the States with legal marijuana laws.  I think that the States that have legal marijuana, if you have marijuana sales of a certain percentage in your business, then you should also be allowed to smoke that within the – the confines of the restaurant or a establishment.  So, that being said, I also think that it should be up to the discretion of the owner.  So, like while there would be a ban, I think that the ban should exclude restaurants who are willing to – to put signs and say, this is a smoking restaurant, and if you choose to go to that restaurant and eat...
Yes, I do think that smoking should be not allowed at every restaurant in this country.  Uh, I have several reasons that I believe this.  First of all, smoking is unhealthy and second-hand smoke will affect people who don't smoke and are trying to enjoy their meal.  Uh, people should not be forced to inhale the smoke of smokers.  Uhm, smokers should not subject others who do not smoke to that.  Second of all, uh, smoking in restaurants interferes with the beautiful smells of the food.  Uhm, people come to restaurants to enjoy delicate taste and lovely foods and when there is tobacco smoke in the air, that ruins the experience for the customers.  And one final reason why I think people should not smoke in restaurants is that smoking can be done outdoors or in homes, but not in public places and that goes back to my first point where...
People shouldn't smoke in public.  If they want to smoke in their house, that's fine.  Smoking is tox – smoke is toxic and harms other people so it shouldn't be allowed.  Uhm, my question is about this survey though.  This survey seems to be taking more than 10 minutes.  At Japan's phone rates, I think paying ¥1500 for a 15- or 20-minute phone call, you don't even break even.  You're actually – is this an actual survey or are you part of a scam with a telephone company to increase rates?  I don't know.  So I don't know what your game is, but this is the last time I'll – I'll play.  Uhm, I see the charge on my phone is going up almost to ¥800 now and I'm not sure that you should be doing this.
Okay.  This is actually an interesting question because I'm from the UK and there actually is a universal ban in all public and closed spaces of smoking.  So, I can actually give you a bit of information about that and, well, one thing is that this – the ban on smoking in public places has improved the general health of the UK population by a significant amount I – I read in the newspaper.  So, if there is a smoking ban, it will have a definite positive effect on the health of the population. Even if there wasn't that evidence, I think that smoking should be banned in all public places anyway.  Again, this is – I read in a newspaper but if tobacco had been discovered now rather than several hundred years ago, it would be banned automatically.  it's – it's just too addictive.  So I think that it is very much a dangerous substance that, you know, shouldn't – shouldn't...

I think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants and you are seeing that in a lot of countries that they've opted to do this.  So certainly some – having that in Japan would be – would be great.  Probably the most important or the main reason why I think this is because I am selfish and I don't smoke, so it doesn't affect me and it would actually – and this would mean not to have somebody smoking next to me.  And the reason – the reason for that is because of second-hand smoke which is really difficult to escape from in an enclosed environment and – and the smoker can go outside to have a smoke but it would be very difficult for a nonsmoker to go outside for a periodic breath of fresh air.  And you'd think that just as smoking affects the taste buds of a smoker, I would imagine that second-hand smoke would affect the flavor of the food that you have ordered in the restaurant, so it is certainly something that would take away...

Personally, I don't believe that smoking should be banned in every restaurant and this is mainly because I believe there is a place for almost anything as long as it's not exceptionally vulgar or harmful to others.  Now, smoking can be considered harmful to others but there is a large percentage of the population that continues this practice as it is something that they appear to enjoy.  So, I think designated smoking areas in restaurants are – while they are a good idea, they are not necessarily foolproof and that you do still get second-hand smoke and that the smoke does attach itself to the clothing of people.  So, I think there – there could be restaurants as long as they are isolated and you have people aware that...

it's a tough question.  Personally, I think that it doesn't have to be banned completely in restaurants.  I don't smoke.  I don't like smoking, but as long as there are sections and they are well ventilated, I don't mind it.  If it's the entire restaurant smoking, I do mind it and that's where I would like to see a ban.  But if they can divide it and you actually have separate room with proper ventilation, I wouldn't mind.  I can see why people would mind and that's basically because of health reasons.  I shouldn't be thrown into an environment, especially in public restaurant where I come to eat and have to breathe in – breathe in second-hand smoke.  it's terrible for you as second-hand smoke there's been multiple – more than numerous scientific studies of health related...

First, I believe smoking itself should not be allowed whether in or outside of a restaurant because of the adverse health effects that it has.  Um, since many people are paying health insurance, uh, smokers and non-smokers are like usually pay the same rates which I believe is wrong, um, and because they have these adverse effects.  Moving on, although I do believe this, I also think that it should be banned in restaurants because of second-hand smoke.  Um, although many places are partitioned, um, there is no way to get around the fact that often you will breathe in second-hand smoke when you are in the vicinity of a smoker.  Um, this raises health risks for non-smokers and people who have  --  who want to preserve themselves from the adverse effects of tobacco and smoking, uh, such as with especially children.  I believe children, um, could be victimized as and if -- 
I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all restaurants throughout the country.  Uh, smoking is a very selfish habit.  The smokers affect all of the people around them whatever their belief in smoking is, whether they are smokers or non-smokers.  Personally, I am a non-smoker and the one thing I really hated after a night out was to return home stinking of cigarette smoke, so feeling you have to wash all of your clothes and yourself before feeling normal again.  There're also the bad health effects of secondary smoke that aren't contained.  So to ban smoking or separate smokers entirely from the general population can only be of benefit.  This happened in my home country and the benefits are huge.  You can have a non...
I don't necessarily agree that smoking should be banned at all the restaurants, um, throughout the country.  I think, um, as it's happening now, you can have smoking area and non-smoking area.  Um, unfortunately, some restaurants with non – with smoking and non-smoking areas don't – don't necessarily properly divide these areas.  I think you could also look at the option of having smoking restaurants and non-smoking restaurants.  For – for me, I don't smoke and I don't necessarily like to be, um, influenced by the smoking of other people and so I would mind going to a restaurant where there is no smoking but some people do enjoy smoking and the option might be given for smokers to gather.  Uh, we shouldn't deny those individuals who like to enjoy a nice restaurant.  It – it provides them with the services...
I do think smoking should be banned because I think it disturbs other people in restaurants.  If you are sitting there enjoying your food and you are not a smoker, then being around that smell can really put off your appetite and can really make it hard for you to enjoy your meal.  The smell is also really bad for people who are not smokers.  If you are not around that and if you are not used to that, then it can really, really mess up all of your time and enjoyment of whatever you are doing.  I think that smoking should not be allowed inside buildings because of all things that it can do.  Also, smo  --  second-hand smoke is a really big deal and it can really be dangerous for children especially and to be around that is just not good for their health.  It can cause asthma and all sorts of other breathing problems that are just hard for children to deal with.
I think banning smoking in all restaurants is a very sensitive topic.  At the moment, I understand in Japan that there are separate rooms for smoking and in restaurants, but they don't always completely filter the smoke from the other restaurant patrons who are not smoking.  In Singapore, smoking is totally banned in restaurants and it is nice to eat or to dine in a smoke-free environment.  However, I think it also depends on the type of the restaurant.  For example, in an izakaya, I don't think it would be wise to ban smoking because many izakaya patrons smoke and I think it's a part of the social experience of going to an izakaya.  However, if it's in the family restaurants where, uh, you can reasonably expect children, then I think it's wise to ban smoking because it's proven that smoke is harmful, uh, particularly for the children.  Also, in fine dining restaurants where it might not be appropriate to – to smoke during dinner and it's also a good thing I think to ban smoking pub...
I think it depends on the type of restaurants that we are talking about.  I would disagree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants, um, in the country.  Um, there are many restaurants where I would agree that perhaps they should – they should remove the, uh, smoking section completely.  I recently went to a family restaurant in Japan called Jonathan's and during the lunchtime hour lunch – during the lunch hour, they opened – they need entire restaurant non-smoking and when that happened then I was – since I'm non-smoker, I was able to sit – uh, be seated more quickly and to sit in one of those seats.  However, I stayed so after the lunch hour is over and then they turned – they changed the section back into a smoking section.  So at that time, um, uh, other people came in and started smoking and then I asked him move to different – to a different seat.  So, um, I think it depends on the situation and the type of restaurant we are talking about.  Um, in some cases where there are, um, places of children...
I think that it would be a good idea for, uh, smoking to be banned in restaurants throughout Japan.  Um, for one thing, health wise, um, it's been shown that, uh, smoke affects not just the person, uh, smoking, who could contact, uh, lung cancer but it also affects the people around them.  And so, uh, by doing this – by making this kind of a rule, it would help the people in the re – all the people in the restaurant to be protected more from illness, um, and you know keep everybody healthy or including the person who is not smoking.  Um, another reason, uh, is that people don't really like – there are lot of people that don't like smokes and, um, so this would be a – a just good manners to keep the air clean for all the people in the restaurant and give...
I agree and disagree with this topic.  I feel that I as a non-smoker I would prefer to have a restaurant that doesn't have a smoking section.  However, if their – if their smoking section is taking care of properly so where the non-smoking section doesn't have to ex – in experience the smell of the smoke or the atmosphere that it creates, then it's okay.  However, there are restaurants that do allow smoking and there isn't a smoking section which can be offensive to those who don't smoke.  Uh, I personally do not like to eat at a restaurant where there is smoking and it depends on where you are at.  Uh, in the States, there may be restaurants that – there are lot of restaurants that have a smoking and non-smoking section, but overseas you find that there's lot of places where they don't have it.
Yes, I think that smoking should be banned and I have a lot of good reasons for it.  Uh, number one, it's a killer that kills your lungs, it kills your – your whole body and it messes your all up and so it kills you.  Number two, it kills other people; second-hand smoking which has been proven in court by someone I know against the tobacco companies and they proved that it was – the second-hand smoking was killing other people just by breathing the smoke that was in the air.  And number three, I think it's a tool of the devil.  It get people to concentrate on that which is wrong in the first place so – and then another reason might be that smoking also permits other bad habits or it creates other bad habits.  And it – what happens...
Yes, I agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the nation.  I think that smokers can find other places to smoke.  I don't know where they would be, but I wouldn't want to be there.  It really bothers me to inhale second-hand smoke blowing around in the fresh air or here even outside.  So, I just feel that – uh, especially restaurants should be banned and you are trying to eat a delicious meal, you are spending money to go out to eat and then you just have this smell smoke coming into your food and it's very irritating besides being very dangerous, because second-hand smoke has been proven to be very dangerous to your health.  So, uh, I would hope that all people would realize this and would, uh, go along with this banned.  Uh, I think it's just great thing to get rid of this.
Well, I think that's a very interesting question, um, the – just – and putting aside the other question about the government having actually that kind of control over businesses and things, um, that's probably a separate target, but today a lot of people and that's how our government is.  It is very controlling and so keeping that in mind I think it would be a good idea for, um, restaurants should be banned from smoking, um, just because of the fact that it is very unhealthy for a lot of people when they come in, second-hand smoke has been proven to be very unhealthy and that's a medical fact.  And so for people to smoke around other people who are eating and drinking and it's very, uh, unpolite and just because the health concern is there and so I think people who want to smoke, of course, smoking, um, morally, um, in our country that it destroys people and it destroys people's health, trouble with cancer.  Um, it's something that should not be promoted by the government; it should be hindered by the government.
I think it would be good for smoking to be banned in public places.  There are many people who are allergic to smoke.  Studies have found that second-hand smoke is very bad for those who are not smokers, and of course, smoking is bad for those who are smokers also.  For the sake of health and just public appearance, I think banning smoking in public would be a very good thing.  It would, um, you can also avoid people being burned by cigarette ashes falling or cigarettes being thrown around while someone speaking with a cigarette in their hand moving their hand and such things like that.  But I don't know, maybe those  --  uh, for me personally smoking, uh, cigarette -- 
Smoking is very bad for your body.  I agree it should be completely banned.  Smoking not only, um, causes cancer, uh, it keeps you from breathing correctly, but it affects everyone around you, it – the air that they breathe is also being corrupted because of the smoke that the person is blowing, uh, from smoking anything, a cigarette or cigar whatever it might be.  Again, by studying God's Word, you can see clearly that our bodies are temple that we should take care of them and that God is clear about, uh, being holy and pure and keeping our bodies, um, healthy so that we can be used by Him to share about his love.  Again, I repeat smoking is bad.  There is nothing good that comes from smoking.  It should be banned in all countries.  I have no problem with...
Uh, smoking is a health hazard and I don't personally enjoy being with smokers and I don't want someone smoking near me when I am eating in a restaurant, but its – if a restaurant can provide a smoking area and a nonsmoking area with sufficient ventilation or screening between the two, then I see absolutely no reason why smokers should not be able to sit down and enjoy a meal while smoking.  I personally do not smoke and I will never smoke and I think smoking can be a great financial drain on a country's health resources, but freedom of choice is much more important than that and I know various friends and relatives of mine are smokers and they should have the ability to choose where they want to eat without being unable to indulge in their add...
I do think smoking should be banned in restaurants because of the, ah, very strong negative effects that it has on the person who's smoking's health and also the people around them and the countries that have ah, implemented this kind of smoking bans such as the UK has shown that they have a very, um, strong effect on the population's health and also I read in the newspaper that, um, if nicotine – well, if, um, tobacco had been discovered, ah, today, then, it would in fact be banned because of the – the sort of very strong addictive properties and also, um, its very negative health effects.  So, the fact that people smoke today, it really is just because it was found a long time ago before the, um – the health problems were really understood.  So, I think it really is quite, ah, dangerous and unnecessary, um, thing to have in people's lives.
I think smoking should be allowed in certain areas or certain restaurants.  There should be a designated area for smoking, but not a large area, and it should be divided or separated from people who choose to have non-smoking seats in a restaurant.  It's annoying if you don't smoke and you still feel the smoky atmosphere and can smell the cigarettes so I think they should be regulated and there should be a definite area and separation of non-smoking and smoking in all establishments or restaurants across the country.  Especially coffee...
Yeah, you know like people, they are sitting in a smoking area, I mean it's – they should make a smoking area for every, every restaurant.  Every nice restaurant should have a smoking area so people kind of sit in the smoking area would like to smoke.  And they smoke, they'll eat and smoke, they eat, they can relax, and people who don't like to smoke, they should have their own area.  So, except for them nobody get like and then have a problem each other and stuff.  You know, it's a smoking area, I understand some people get – they don't like the smoke when they eat.  I don't like it either sometimes even I'm a smoker, but you know sometimes, it's better that people like – they go like to – like a smoking area and they sit there and they smoke and then, you know, or like they eat in the normal area and when they need to smoke, they go outside or sit inside in the smoking area.  I don't know, but you know I understand people who don't like the smoking area and I think they'll if it's a small space – and a really small space, they shouldn't like have a smoking area.  They should just have a non-smoking area then people go outside and smoke.  Why, it should - should be no problem for nobody in the, you know...
Uh, I do not think that smoking should be banned in all restaurants all over the country, because there are two points.  One is, it will be bad for our businesses.  They will not get as many customers because customers will want to go to a place where they can smoke and eat, so perhaps they will stay at home and that will take money away from the businesses.  So, uh, that includes students or people who work out – outside of their home.  Outside, I mean, outside of the office normally.  Also, if you do not allow people to smoke inside or in restaurants, then they will start smoking outside more, and this will be a bigger bother to the people outside on the street who do not want to smell it.  But if you keep it in the restaurants, you can keep them in the separate section, and I think that would be better for smokers and non-smokers alike.
It goes without saying that smoking is harmful to yourself.  However, I think that the reason smoking should be banned in, uh, public places or at least in restaurants is because the smoking can be very harmful to the people around you.  Uh, that being said, I don't think that businesses should be held liable for your own health concerns, because they are – if they are – if they are producing certain amount of their revenue via tobacco sales, I think that you should have an exception, it should be allowed to – you should be allowed to consume tobacco within the confines of that restaurant.  Uh, this goes for the States with legal marijuana laws as well.  If you were selling a certain amount of marijuana in your restaurant, then you should have a legal consumption of that product within the con...
I think that people should not be allowed to smoke in restaurants.  There are several reasons why I think that people should not smoke in restaurants.  The first reason is that smoking is unhealthy, and when people smoke, it creates what is called second-hand smoke.  People who do not smoke cigarettes are affected by second-hand smoke and some studies show that second-hand smoke may cause cancer or other diseases.  Therefore, smokers should not subject others who do not smoke to the toxins that are in these things they burn with their cigarettes.  So that is one reason why people should not smoke in ciga – smoke in restaurants.  One more reason why I think people should not smoke in restaurants is that the smell of smoke takes away from the smell of the food.  People come to restaurants to enjoy the scents and the beautiful smells of food, and if tobacco is in the air, it ruins that experience for people.  People are paying...
Smoking is a toxic burden on everyone in the society, and it should be stopped at any cost, uhm, not only in restaurants but in public.  To walk into a store or into a restaurant and having a group of people sitting outside the door smoking, blowing smoke into your face is the same as smoking yourself.  I don't want to smoke so I don't think people should smoke for me.  They shouldn't be blowing smoke in my face.  But people do that.  I don't know the reason for this survey but it's a very strange thing to ask people about smoking.  Uhm, I was wondering if anybody associated with the – the survey could get back to me and tell me what is the goal of your survey.  So we call, we do the survey, but we never know why you want us to do it.  Do you even listen to it?  It...
I do agree that smoking should be banned in all restaurants.  Smoking has very bad effects on the health.  I mean it's – it's terrible for people's health, not just the people who are smoking but the people around them.  And in restaurants, even if you have – you know, enclosed spaces for people to smoke.  The smoke being smoke, it floats, it moves around and it does affect, you know, passive smoking, it does affect all of people who are around.  And as I said in the previous part – in the previous recording, actually if tobacco had been discovered today rather than several hundred years, it would be banned anyway.  It would – it would not be allowed to be used.  it's just the fact that it was discovered many years ago and people smoke and continue to smoke and it's just become a habit really.  And also I think it's a way for the government to earn money to tax tobacco and they tend to be put...

Smoking has been banned in restaurants in a lot of countries and I think that's something that we should see more of, not less of.  So certainly, in countries in Europe or in Japan where they – they haven't adopted this ban, I think they should really consider it.  And for two main reasons really and they are both connect to second-hand smoke and that is – and the first reason is very difficult to escape second-hand smoke in an enclosed environment.  it's very easy for a smoker to go out and smoke outside if they get the craving but it's – you can't really expect a nonsmoker to go outside for a breath of fresh air if they get the craving for that.  And the second thing is we got to think of what a restaurant does.  It serves food and tobacco and smoke can affect the flavor of food and just as smokers, the taste buds are somewhat dulled by smoking, I would imagine that second-hand smoke does the same thing for a nonsmoker.  So I don't think it does a great...

Personally, I don't believe that smoking should be banned everywhere, you know, in terms of restaurants.  And this is because – this is something that a lot of people take – take part in.  It – it's been proven to be harmful to health but there is a large percentage of the population that still continues to enjoy it.  And if you take that away from people, there will be some backlash.  So, there are ways of regulating this.  You can stick with the smoking sections in restaurants, but what a better idea might be is to isolate restaurants from maybe family restaurants where you have no smoking whatsoever.  So that way you are not going to have people getting the second-hand smoke, the smell attached to it, and the – the harmful side effects.  So I – I believe there is a place for most things in this world and smoking does apply...

Well, just to continue my point on the health reasons behind it.  One is – I don't – me personally, I don't want to be a restaurant with someone who is smoking and we are breathing air and you don't have any control and it's going all over you and you stink and you got health issues pertaining to it. So it's really just something that needs to be done.  It is one thing that they are very proactive in America.  Almost all restaurants there you can't smoke it, and even more recently even in bars.  So [***] here in Japan, you won't be able to smoke in nonsmoking.  So this is a very controversial topic and I can understand why some people want to be able to go and drink and smoke, but people have to remember that you are not – when you drink, you are not affecting the person next to you, you are damaging your own body.  But when you smoke, your – you are affecting those all around you whether they choose to accept it or not.  So that's my kind of main argument.  That's...

Some might – might – some might believe that, uh, allowing smoking is allowing freedom.  I believe that smoking should not be allowed in the restaurants because of the adverse effects it has on non-smokers, especially for young children.  Um, because second-hand smoke has been proven to have very harmful effects on lungs, especially in developing children as their organs are developing, and if second-hand smoking cause venous damage to their, uh, lungs and even though they have not chosen to smoke, we are – we would in essence be forcing the second-hand smoke and therefore adverse effects of smoking on children who have not chosen to smoke yet.  Also, I believe that it produces, uh, unfriendly atmosphere into non-smokers in the restaurant as well.  Um, this causes, uh, the adverse health effects, not only for the children but also other adults and other people who've chosen not to smoke.
I agree with the statement that smoking should be banned in all the restaurants throughout the country.  As a non-smoker myself, I am also aware of what it's like to go out and be affected by people who smoke.  Smoking is a very selfish habit because the person who is smoking not only creating all that smoke they are then distribute – distributing it to the people all around them, whether they'd be smokers or non-smokers.  It's in a way pollutes the atmosphere of the building or place they are in.  This has the adverse effect on non-smokers of them smelling of the cigarette smoke or having to breathe in that cigarette smoke which has negative effects for your health.  And also as a non-smoker myself, I have noticed returning home I really hated being smelling of the cigarette smoke feeling you have to change...
Scientists and medical, um, personnels have constantly warned people that smoking is not necessarily good for health.  Uh, we shouldn't force people to follow that advice.  There is freedom of choice, um, but there are people who choose not to, uh, smoke and should not have to endure the smoke of individuals who choose to smoke.  I think that under such circumstances smoking should be – should – smoking areas should be clearly, uh, defined so that those who want to smoke can smoke in the restaurants, um, or those who don't want to smoke can be protected from the influence of smoke – second-hand smoke which, um, scientists and medical personnel have claimed to be dangerous as well, um, or just have...
I do think that smoking should be banned from restaurants and public places because of how much it can affect a non-smoker's eating experience and just experience in general.  They have the smoke in the air it can make it hard to enjoy the things that are around them and I think that it can be really difficult for people who are not used to being around smokers.  Also, I think that the smell of cigarette smoke is offensive in some ways because it's very, very terrible smell and I think that being around non-smokers – non-smokers being around smokers can make it really difficult for them to enjoy everything that goes on around them.  Also, second-hand smoke is really bad for your health and it can be really dangerous for children especially and so I think that smoking should be pay – banned in public areas because I think of how – because of how bad it can be for a person to...
I think the question of whether smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the country is a very delicate one and depends on many factors.  In Japan, smokers are already segregated in the restaurants and cafes into the separate areas but I do understand that such an area does not completely isolate the smoke from other non-smoking section.  However, I think it also depends very much on the type of establishment that, uh, the proposal is need for.  For example, in an izakaya, I don't think it would be prudent to ban smoking completely as in an izakaya many patrons do smoke, and as such, it would you know take away something from the experience of going to an izakaya.  However, in the family restaurant where there is a reasonable expectation of children, uh, with families, I think it's reasonable to ban smoking completely because it's proven that cigarette smoke is harmful, especially for the minors, yeah.  Also, maybe in...
I would disagree that smoking should be banned at all restaurants, although it depends on the situation.  Um, for instance, I went – recently went to a family restaurant called Jonathan's in Japan, um, and it was during the lunch hour.  During the lunch hours, um, the restaurant normally has a section for smoking.  However, during that hour, they removed, um, the restriction and made all of seats non-smoking because of that I was able to be seated more quickly and that was nice.  However, I stayed later then a lot of time and they changed the section back into the smoking section at which time other customers came in and then they – already began to, um, smoke and that was uncomfortable for me so I asked people to another seat.  Certainly, if it's like a family restaurant there are many families that come with children and – and smoking does have adverse affects on small children, even if they are not the one smoking.  Um, so in that sense, I think for family restaurants, yes, smoking should be banned completely.  However, for places like bars and other places where, um, smoking is also just part of the atmosphere and the social atmosphere, I would say that it's important to be...
I think it would be a good idea to ban, uh, smoking in all the restaurants in Japan.  Uh, one of the main reasons for this is because of the health effects of smoking, it's been shown that, uh, smoking affects not only the person who is smoking, who could contact, uh, lung cancer as a result but it also affects the people around him which, uh, in the home it could be the family but in a restaurant it could be anybody eating a meal there.  So, uh, I really think that, uh, preventing people from smoking, uh, pro – protects everybody health wise in the restaurant.  Another reason that I think that it's important is that, um, some people don't enjoy smoke in the restaurant and by not smoking this allows everybody in the restaurant, except maybe the person who love to smoke, uh, it hel – allows them to enjoy a meal and not have to worry about the air being...
I agree with what – uh, what I was saying before that if they have a smoking section then it's okay to have it in the restaurant.  However, as long as the smoking section is regulated properly so that even non-smoking section doesn't have to have that same atmosphere.  However, for the restaurants do – that do not have it separated, I feel that it should be banned because not everybody enjoys being around smoke and some people have medical conditions so they can't be around smoke.  So, it's unfair and it can be offensive to those who don't smoke if a restaurant does not separate it.  If it's not going to be separated, I feel that it should be banned completely that – for the fairness of everybody and the people that do smoke can go out by to the designated smoking areas.  Other – otherwise, it's not fair for everyone.
Smoking definitely should be banned because it really destroys a lot of things.  First of all, it destroys the person's body.  I live in Sarku Japan where a lot of people smoke and a lot of people have cancer because of the smoking.  Secondly, it also not only destroys that person's body which it did in my grandfather's case, he has – he's had a lung cancer and passed away.  Secondly, smoking affects people around you and it's been proven that in court in America where a lawyer that I have heard about and know some of the relationship with it took the tobacco company to court over second-hand smoking and he won and they lost and they paid in millions of dollars because of that, okay.  Thirdly, smoking also is a very, very addictive habit and we should never be addicted to anything and I have a br...
Yes, I think smoking should be banned in all restaurants across the nation because it is very hazardous to your health and proven to be and you go into a restaurant and you think you are going to be having a delicious meal, your food comes and along with it a big puff of smoke goes through your – over your food and in your – into your nose and to your lungs and causing damage to allow this to continue in the restaurants.  I don't even like to go into a restaurant that has smoking because of this and we shouldn't be the ones to suffer for that we shouldn't – it's not a place to be smoking.  So, I do agree with the banned and I will sign petition for such to take away.  It's – it's very difficult to...
I think it's a very important question and someone to consider for today because, um, putting aside the question that should government have control of this kind of thing in society today but it already does and so that will be totally separate talk altogether.  And because government already is – has that kind of control I think maybe it should take this part and say that restaurants should not have smoking and it's very proven that health wise, uh, second-hand smoke is very bad or it's even worse than first-hand smoke and so even those people who are smoking in restaurants, um, it is even worse for other people around them.  Um, and so I think because of that effect it should be banned and also because other people who are around them it's just makes them uncomfortable or people have convictions about not smoking and they don't want their children around smoke and so, uh, if they're going to a restaurant they go in there to have a meal and they should, you know, and then they get – get bombarded by maybe someone next door that's smoking and – and they might feel like, ah, I have to leave this meal because they are worried about their kids, they are worried about...
I think it would be a very good idea for smoking to be banned in restaurants.  First of all, studies have shown that smoking is very bad for the person who is doing the smoking.  Studies have also shown that smoking is very bad for those who receive the smoke second-hand what they call second-hand smokers, and so if there's no smoking in restaurants that's a very good thing.  Also, um, the nasty smell of cigarette smoke combined with food, it's just not a good mix and then also you avoid damage to the facilities, the property of the restaurant by cigarette ashes falling or whatever.  Many times in restaurants you have older people or young children who may especially have a hard time with the cigarette smoke.  Those with asthma have a very hard time with it, and it – it's very harmful to people's lungs.  The smell is – is nasty and just doesn't go well...
I agree that smoking should be banned in restaurants, it already has been in the United States and for that I am grateful.  I find myself, um, as I grew up I was always exposed to smoking and having to breathe the air that other people were smoking and it caused me to cough and to feel sick, but now with the smoking not being there I can enjoy the food, I can enjoy the environment, I don't have to worry about what I'm breathing.  Um, it already again has been, um, stopped in America, and I am not sure about Japan, but I do believe it should be banned in all restaurants.  It not only changes, uh, the air we breathe but it also changes your taste for food, as you smell the smoke in the air.  Um, I am grateful that I am not a smoker and wish that many others would stop also.  And again it's because in God's Word, it is clear...
